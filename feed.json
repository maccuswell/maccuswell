Read <a href=\"https://www.stumax.com/2024/05/28/information-architecture-in.html\">Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stumax.com/2024/05/30/information-architecture-in.html\">Part 2</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this post, I’m riffing on the work of several <a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/\">IAC24</a> speakers, predominantly presentations by <a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/opening-keynote-emily-bender/\">Emily Bender</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/the-politics-of-classification-information-architecture-and-artificial-intelligence/\">Andrea Resmini</a>.</p>\n<p>In Part 2 of this series, I looked at the benefits of Generative AI. The use cases at which GenAI excels are generally those in which the AI is a <em>partner with humans</em>, not a replacement for humans. In these cases, GenAI is <em>part</em> of a process that a human would do anyway and where the human is ultimately in control of the output.</p>\n<p>But GenAI output can have numerous issues, from hallucinating (making up false information) to generating content with biases, stereotypes, and other subtle and not-so-subtle errors. We can be lulled into believing the AI output is true because it’s presented as human-like language, so it seems like a human-like process created it. But although GenAI can create convincing human-like output, at its core it’s just a machine. It’s important to know the difference between what we think AI is and what it actually is, and between what we think it’s capable of and what it’s actually capable of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aiisnthuman\">AI isn’t human</h2>\n<p>Here is basically what Generative AI does: it makes a mathematical representation of some large corpus of material, such as text or images. It then makes new versions of that material using math. For example, if you feed an LLM (large language model) a lot of examples of text and have it run a bunch of statistics on how different words relate to each other, you can then use those statistics to recombine words in novel ways that are eerily human-like. A process called fine-tuning will teach the LLM the boundaries of acceptable output, but fine-tuning is necessarily limited and can’t always keep GenAI output error- or bias-free. (And the process may introduce new biases.) LLMs produce statistically-generated, unmoderated output that <em>sounds</em> human-generated.</p>\n<p>Therein lies the main problem: Generative AI produces <em>human-like</em> output while not being human, or self-aware, or anything like an actual thinking thing. As Andrea Resmini put it in his talk at IAC24, “AI is technology that <em>appears</em> to be intelligent.” Emphasis on “appears.” Since GenAI output seems human but isn’t, it tricks our brains into believing that it’s more reliable and trustworthy than it actually is.</p>\n<p>Humans want to see human qualities in everything. We anthropomorphize; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scottjenson_the-turing-test-is-testing-us-not-the-chatbot-activity-7200495376280215552-9FaN?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios\"> we invest objects in the world with human attributes</a>. We see human faces in things where they don’t exist.<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a> We get easily wrapped up in the experience of seeing human qualities in other things and forget that the thing itself <em>is just a thing</em>; we’ve projected our own experience onto it.</p>\n<p>It’s not too dissimilar from experiencing art. We bring meaning — our filters, our subjective experience — to the experience of art. We invest art with meaning. There is no experience of art <em>without</em> our participation in it. Your experience of a piece of culture might be very different from mine because of our different life experiences and thinking patterns and the different ways we interact with the work.</p>\n<p>In the same way, when we participate in AI experiences we invest those experiences with meaning that comes from our unique subjective being. GenAI isn’t capable of delivering meaning. We bring the meaning to the experience. And the meaning we’re bringing In the moment is based on how we’ve learned to interact with other humans.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/ai-hype/\">recent online article</a>, Navneet Alang wrote about his experience of asking ChatGPT to write a story. He sought an explanation for his sensation of how human-like the story felt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Robin Zebrowski, professor and chair of cognitive science at Beloit College in Wisconsin, explains the humanity I sensed this way: “The only truly linguistic things we’ve ever encountered are things that have minds. And so when we encounter something that looks like it’s doing language the way we do language, all of our priors get pulled in, and we think, ‘Oh, this is clearly a minded thing.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>AI simulates human thought without human awareness</h2>\n<p>Attributing human thought to computer software has been going on long enough to have a name: <a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-eliza-effect/\">The ELIZA Effect</a>. ELIZA was an early computer program that would ask simple questions in response to text input. The experience of chatting with ELIZA could feel human-like – almost like a therapy session – though the illusion would eventually be broken by the limited capacity of the software.</p>\n<p>GenAI is a way better ELIZA, but it’s still the same effect. When we impute human qualities to software, we’re making a category error: we’re equating symbolic computations with the ability to think.</p>\n<p>GenAI can simulate the act of communicating intent and make statements that appear authoritative. But, as Dr. Bender said in her IAC24 keynote, AI doesn’t have intent. It can’t know what it’s saying, and it’s very possible for it to say something very confidently that is very wrong and possibly very harmful.</p>\n<p>GenAI engines lack (at least) these important human qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>humility - the ability to say “I don’t know”</li>\n<li>judgment — the ability to say “that’s not possible” or “that’s not advisable” or “that’s a racist question”, or to evaluate and question data that doesn’t seem right<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a></li>\n<li>the ability to learn from feedback mechanisms like pain receptors or peer pressure</li>\n<li>sentience - the ability to feel or experience through senses</li>\n<li>cognition - the ability to think</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those last points are really important: Computers can’t think and they can’t feel. They can’t <em>know</em> what they’re doing. They are machines made of code that can consolidate patterns of content and do some fancy math to recombine those patterns in novel ways. No more. And it’s right to be skeptical and maybe even scared of things that can’t reason and have no empathy but that can imitate external human behavior really well. They are not human, just human-like.</p>\n<p>And so here’s the problem: if we confuse the human-like output from a GenAI engine with actual human output, we will have imputed all sorts of human-like qualities to that output. We will expect it to have passed through human filters like judgment and humility (because that’s what a human would do, and what we’re interacting with <em>appears</em> human). We will open ourselves up to accepting bad information because it sounds like it might be good. No matter that we might also get good information, if we’re not able to properly discern the bad information, we make ourselves vulnerable to all sorts of risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aitrainingdatahoweverishuman…veryveryhuman\">AI training data, however, <em>is</em> human… very, very human</h2>\n<p>So, human-like behavior without human thought behind it is a big problem with GenAI. Another major problem has to do with the data that’s been used to train the large language models GenAI engines are based on. And for the moment I’m setting aside the ethical questions around appropriating people’s work without notice or compensation. Let’s just focus for now on the issue of data quality.</p>\n<p>GenAI scales the ability to create text and images based on what humans have already created. It does this by ingesting vast quantities of human-created content, making mathematical representations of probabilities inherent in that content, and then replaying those patterns in different combinations.</p>\n<p>Through this process, GenAI reflects back to us a representation of ourselves. It’s like looking in a mirror in a well-lit bathroom, in a way, because it reveals not only our best qualities but also our flaws and biases. As Andrea Resmini pointed out, data is always dirty. It’s been created and edited by humans, and so it has human fallibility within it. Whatever reality was inherent in the training data will be reflected in the GenAI output. (Unless we take specific steps to hide or moderate those flaws, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/28/24083814/google-gemini-ai-bias-ethics\">those don’t always go well</a>.)</p>\n<p>If GenAI is sometimes a bathroom mirror, it’s also sometimes a funhouse mirror, distorting the interactions that it produces due to deficiencies in the training data (and because it is not self-aware and can’t correct itself). For any question that matches a sufficient amount of training data, the GenAI agent can sometimes give a reasonably accurate answer. Where there is little or no training data, a GenAI agent may make up an answer, and this answer will likely be wrong.</p>\n<p>It’s garbage in, garbage out. Even if you get the occasional treasure, there’s still a lot of trash to deal with. How do we sort out which is which?</p>\n<h2 id=\"contextcluelessnessandpsychopathy\">Context cluelessness and psychopathy</h2>\n<p>So, a GenAI engine might give you a response that’s 100% correct or 0% correct or anywhere in between. How do you know where on the spectrum any given response may lie? Without context clues, it’s impossible to be sure.</p>\n<p>When we use search engines to find an answer to a question, we get some context from the sites we visit. We can see if it’s a source with a name we recognize, or if obvious care has been taken to craft a good online experience. And we can tell when a site has been built poorly, or is so cluttered with ads or riddled with spelling and grammar errors that we realize we should move on to the next source.</p>\n<p>GenAI engines smooth all of its sources out like peanut butter on a slice of white bread, so that those context clues disappear into the single context of the AI agent.</p>\n<p>And if the agent is responding as if it were human, it’s not giving you human clues to its veracity and trustworthiness. Most humans feel social pressure to be truthful and accurate in most situations, to the best of their abilities. A GenAI agent does not feel anything, much less social pressure. There is nothing in a GenAI engine that can be motivated to be cautious or circumspect or to say “I don’t know.” A GenAI agent is never going to come back to you the next day and say, “You know, I was thinking about my response to you and I think I might have gotten it wrong.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, a human has tells. A human might hedge or hesitate, or look you in the eye or avoid your gaze. A GenAI agent won’t. Its tone will be basically the same regardless of the truth or accuracy of its response. This capacity to be completely wrong while appearing confident and authoritative is the most disturbing aspect of GenAI to me.</p>\n<p>As GenAI <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?feature=shared\">gets more human-like</a> in its behaviors it becomes a more engaging and convincing illusion, bypassing our BS detectors and skepticism receptors. As a result, the underlying flaws in GenAI become more dangerous and more insidious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arethereevenmoreproblemswithgenaiyeahafew…\">Are there even more problems with GenAI? Yeah, a few…</h2>\n<p>I’ve focused here on some high-level, systemic issues with GenAI, but there are many others. I would encourage you to read this Harvard Business Review article titled “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2024/05/ais-trust-problem\">AI’s Trust Problem</a>” for an excellent breakdown of 12 specific AI risks, from ethical concerns to environmental impact. If AI’s lack of humanity alone isn’t enough to make you cautious about how you use it, perhaps the HBR article will do the trick.</p>\n<h2 id=\"allthatsaid...\">All that said…</h2>\n<p>For all its faults, Generative AI is here to stay, like it or not. Businesses are gonna business, and we humans love a technology that makes our lives easier in some way and <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/?intent=121\">damn the consequences</a>. And, as I pointed out in Part 2, GenAI can be truly useful, and we should use it for what it’s good at. My point in going through the pros and cons in such detail is to help set up some structure for how to use GenAI wisely.</p>\n<p>So, if we accept that this type of AI is our new reality, what can we do to mitigate the risks and make it a better, more useful information tool? Is it possible information architects have a big role to play here? Stay tuned, dear reader… These questions and more will be answered in the final part of this series, coming soon to this very blog.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia\">pareidolia</a>. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>At IAC24, Sherrard Glaittli and Erik Lee explored the concept of <em>data poisoning</em> in an excellent and entertaining talk titled “<a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/beware-of-glorbo-a-use-case-and-survey-of-the-fight-against-llms-disseminating-misinformation/\">Beware of Glorbo: A Use Case and Survey of the Fight Against LLMs Disseminating Misinformation</a>” <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:2\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

As <a href=\"https://jarango.com/2024/04/14/information-architects-must-embrace-ai/\">Jorge Arango has pointed out</a>, there was a lot of hand-wringing and Chicken-Littleing about GenAI at IAC24 – and justifiably so – yet not a lot of acknowledgement of the benefits. So let’s look at the useful things that GenAI can do.</p>\n<p>In her IAC24 talk “<a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/structured-content-in-the-age-of-ai-the-ticket-to-the-promised-land/\">Structured Content in the Age of AI: The Ticket to the Promised Land?</a>,” Carrie Hane offered the following list of things that Generative AI could do well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Summarizing documents</li>\n<li>Synthesizing information</li>\n<li>Editing written content</li>\n<li>Translation</li>\n<li>Coding</li>\n<li>Categorization</li>\n<li>Text to speech // Speech to text</li>\n<li>Search</li>\n<li>Medical research and diagnosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This seems like an excellent starting point (I might only add image generation to the above). We might want to caveat this list a bit, though. For one thing, we should remain skeptical on the use of GenAI in specific professional applications such as medical research and coding, at least until we’ve had time to see if we can poke holes in the extraordinary claims coming from AI researchers. Despite the legitimate promise of these tools, we’re still learning what AI is actually capable of and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/seeing-what-others-dont/202402/spotting-exaggerated-claims-for-ai-superiority-over-experts\">how we need to use it</a>. There may well be good uses for these tools in industry verticals, but we’re almost certainly seeing overblown claims at this point.</p>\n<p>For another thing, as Carrie would go on to point out, in many cases getting useful, trustworthy output from GenAI requires some additional technological support, such as integrating knowledge graphs and <a href=\"https://github.blog/2024-04-04-what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-what-does-it-do-for-generative-ai/\">RAG</a> (retrieval augmented generation). These technologies have yet to become well understood or thoroughly integrated in AI models.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.everythingisaremix.info/create-content-with-chatgpt-and-ai-2024-landing\">online course</a>, Kirby Ferguson listed some additional uses for GenAI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorming, problem-solving, and expanding ideas</li>\n<li>Understanding and incorporating diverse experiences</li>\n<li>Generating pragmatic titles with good keywords</li>\n<li>Proofreading documents</li>\n<li>Creating project schedules and realistic time estimates</li>\n<li>Outlining and initial content structuring</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These use cases fall into one of two patterns:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Process some supplied text in a specific way according to my directions. I’ll then review the output and do something with it. (And possibly feed it back to the AI for more processing.)</li>\n<li>Output some starting text that I can then process further according to my needs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, we’re not handing control of anything to the AI engine. We’re using it as a tool to scale up our ability to do work we could have done without the AI. <strong>GenAI is a <em>partner</em> in our work, not a replacement.</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think you can overstate the real benefits of these use cases. For rote, repetitive work, or for things like research or analysis that’s not novel and is relatively straightforward but time-consuming, GenAI is a real boon. As long as there’s a human taking responsibility for the end product, there are a lot of use cases where GenAI makes sense and can lead to significant productivity and quality-of-life gains.</p>\n<p>And a lot of the use cases listed above are like that: time-consuming, boring, energy-draining tasks. Anything that relieves some of that mental drudgery is welcome. This is why GenAI has gained so much traction over the past year or so: because it’s actually quite useful.</p>\n<p>I want to be clear: there’s a lot of hype around AI, and a lot of its benefits have been overstated or haven’t been studied enough to understand them thoroughly. There are a lot of claims around AI’s utility in everything from drug manufacturing, to medical diagnosis, to stopping climate change, to replacing search engines, to replacing whole categories of workers. Many – maybe most – of these claims will turn out to be overblown, but there will still be significant benefits to be had from the pursuit of AI applications.</p>\n<p>A frequent comparison to the hype around Generative AI is the hype a decade ago about autonomous vehicles. Full self-driving turns out to be really, really hard to accomplish outside of certain very narrow use cases. Autonomous vehicles that can go safely anywhere in any conditions may be impossible to create without another generational shift in technology. But the improvements to the driving experience that we’ve gained in pursuit of fully autonomous driving are real and have made operating a car easier and safer.</p>\n<p>I think it’s likely that AI – Generative AI, in particular – will turn out to be more like that: a useful tool even if it falls far short of today’s breathless predictions.</p>\n<p>So, GenAI excels when it’s used as a thinking tool, a partner working alongside humans to scale content generation. And like any tool that humans have ever used, we have to use GenAI responsibly in order to realize the full benefits. That means we have to understand and account for its real, serious weaknesses and dangers. In Kat King’s words, we have to understand when AI is a butter knife and when it’s a rusty bayonet. In Part 3 of this series, we’ll contemplate the pointy end of the bayonet.</p>\n",

The annual information architecture conference was held in my home city of Seattle this year, and despite not having to travel for it, it’s taken me a while to consolidate my thoughts.</p>\n<p>No matter. It’s not about being first or last, just about crossing the finish line. So here I am, like a pokey yet determined walker in a marathon, presenting the first of a four-part series of posts on IA and AI, mainly inspired by presentations and conversations at IAC24 and things I’ve noticed since then as a result of better understanding the field.</p>\n<p>In this first part, like a good information school graduate, I argue for better definitions of AI to support better discussions of AI issues. The second part covers what Generative AI seems to be useful for, and the third part is about the dangers and downsides of Generative AI. Finally, I’ll look at the opportunities for the information architecture practice in this new AI-dominated world, and I’ll suggest the proper role for AI in general (spoiler: the AI serves us, not the other way around).</p>\n<p>Note: I used ChatGPT to brainstorm the title of the series and to create a cover photo for each post. Other than that, I wrote and edited all the content. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide whether an AI editor would have made any of this better or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"themanyfacesofai\">The many faces of AI</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with some definitions.</p>\n<p>AI is not a single thing. <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> is a catchall term that describes a range of technologies, sub-disciplines, and applications. We tend to use the term AI to apply to cutting-edge or future technologies, making the definition something of a moving target. In fact, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect\">AI Effect</a>” is the term used for a phenomenon where products that were once considered AI are redefined as something else, and the term AI is then applied to “whatever hasn’t been done yet”<a id=\"fnref:1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:1\">[1]</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let’s talk a bit about what we mean when we say “AI”. As I learned from Austin Govella and Michelle Caldwell’s workshop “<a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/information-architecture-for-enterprise-ai/\">Information Architecture for Enterprise AI</a>,” there are at least three different types of AI:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Generative AI</strong> creates content in response to prompts.</li>\n<li><strong>Content AI</strong> processes and analyzes content, automating business processes, monitoring and interpreting data, and building reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge AI</strong> extracts meaning from content, building knowledge bases, recommendations engines, and expert systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most of us are probably barely aware of the second two types of AI tools, but we know all about the first one. In fact, when most of us say “AI” these days, we’re really thinking about Generative AI, and probably ChatGPT specifically. The paradigm of a chat interface to large language models (LLMs) has taken up all the oxygen in AI discussion spaces, and therefore chat-based LLMs have become synonymous with AI. But it’s important to remember that’s just one version of machine-enhanced knowledge representation systems.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@marketing_89629/discover-the-types-of-artificial-intelligence-in-2024-cc46d5e77b2d\">other ways to slice AI</a>. AI can be narrow (focused on a specific task or range of tasks), general (capable of applying knowledge like humans do), or super (better than humans).<a id=\"fnref:2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn:2\">[2]</a> It can include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, and expert systems. There are subcategories of each, and more specific types and applications than I could list here.</p>\n<p>The different types of AI can also take different forms. Like the ever-expanding list of pumpkin-spiced foods in the fall, AI is included in more and more of the digital products we use, from photo editors to writing tools to note-taking apps to social media… you name it. In some cases, AI is a mild flavoring that gently seasons the UI or works in the background to enhance the software. In other cases, it’s an overwhelming, in-your-face, dominant flavor of an app or service.</p>\n<p>As IAs, we need to do a better job helping to define the discrete versions of AI so that we can have better discussions about what it is, what it can do, and how we can live with it. Because, as Kat King pointed out in her talk “<a href=\"https://www.theiaconference.com/sessions/probabilities-possibilities-and-purpose/\">Probabilities, Possibilities, and Purpose</a>,” AI can be used for good or ill. Borrowing a metaphor from Luciano Floridi, Kat argued that AI is like a knife. It can be like a butter knife – something that is used as a tool – or like a rusty bayonet – something used as a weapon.</p>\n<p>In containing this inherent dichotomy, AI is like any other technology, any other tool that humans have used to augment our abilities. It’s up to us to determine how to use AI tools, and to use them responsibly. To do this, we need to stop using the term “AI” indiscriminately and start naming the many faces of AI so that we can deal with each individually.</p>\n<p>There are some attempts at this <a href=\"https://frickingruvin.medium.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-taxonomies-caa2ddc6cc7e\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CategoryTree?target=Category%3AArtificial+intelligence&amp;mode=categories&amp;namespaces=\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ontotext.com/blog/the-innograph-artificial-intelligence-taxonomy/\">here</a>, and the EU has a great <a href=\"https://eit.europa.eu/sites/default/files/creation_of_a_taxonomy_for_the_european_ai_ecosystem_final.pdf\">white paper</a> on AI in the EU ecosystem. But we need better, more accessible taxonomies of AI and associated technologies. And, as IAs, we need to set an example by using specific language to describe what we mean.</p>\n<p>So, in that spirit, I’m going to focus the next two parts of this series specifically on <em>Generative AI</em>, the kind of AI that includes ChatGPT and similar LLM-powered interfaces. In Part 2, I’ll talk about the benefits of GenAI, and in Part 3, I’ll look at GenAI’s dark side.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Per Tesler’s Theorem, <a href=\"https://www.nomodes.com/larry-tesler-consulting/adages-and-coinages\">apparently misquoted</a>. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnref:1\"> ↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>General AI and Super AI are still theoretical.

There were a lot of good ideas, yet none of them seemed to add up to much. The action scenes were amazing, but without stakes, they started to feel gratuitous.

				"content_text": "[This review](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/john-wick-3-review-film-parabellum-1203210529/) of _John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum_ pretty much echoes my own feelings, especially this bit:\n\n> \"But as masterfully executed as the action is, watching two-plus hours of mayhem without any palpable dramatic stakes, or nuance, or any emotion at all save bloodlust offers undeniably diminishing returns.\"\n\nDespite going into them with low expectations, I really liked the first movie, and especially the second, because as over-the-top as they were, there were pretty simple stories to follow, and Wick himself was sympathetic.\n\nI found it much harder to understand the logic of _Chapter 3_, or to care much about the characters. There were a lot of good ideas, yet none of them seemed to add up to much. The action scenes were amazing, but without stakes, they started to feel gratuitous. Boring, even.\n\nI'll still be there if there's a _Chapter 4_. If so, let's hope the filmmakers can recapture the formula that made _Chapter 2_ so good: stakes + a clear goal + great action = a cracking good time.\n",

Playoff hockey is not like regular season hockey. The goal of regular season hockey is to get enough wins to get into the playoffs, and to stay relatively healthy doing it. In the regular season, talented, under-sized hockey players like those that fill Tampa&rsquo;s roster can use their speed and quickness to get into the soft spots and find goal-scoring opportunities.</p>\n<p>In playoff hockey, there are no soft spots.

In playoff hockey, it takes grit and toughness to win games, but also size and strength and an ability to physically dominate your opponent.</p>\n<p>Tampa has built a team around fast, nimble, and under-sized forwards and young, talented defensemen. In the last two games against Columbus, the forwards were getting pushed around and the defensemen were showing their inexperience. (Actually, even Ryan McDonagh, who&rsquo;s been so solid all year long, looked like he was out of his depth a few times.) And when the Lightning tried to come out and play a more physical game, as they did in the second period of Game 2, they didn&rsquo;t do it smartly. Alex Killorn&rsquo;s late hit early in the period earned him an interference penalty which led to a Blue Jackets power play goal.</p>\n<p>In the regular season, the Lightning dominated their opponents by finding the time and space to create plays. In the playoffs, that time and space doesn&rsquo;t exist unless you create it with your body.</p>\n<p>In the regular season, the Lightning&rsquo;s bread and butter were quick passing and pretty goals. In the playoffs, pretty goals are much, much harder to come by.

He jumped three feet off the ground when I reached out to touch him, but he didn&rsquo;t run. He followed us up the stairs and stopped at the doorway, watching us for a while, chatting, until he wandered off to wherever he came from.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And so it went for the next few weeks, us returning home, him on the walkway, following us up to the third floor and waiting at the doorway, never coming in, but hanging out on the landing to chat, getting head rubs, and occasionally even sitting on my lap, but only if I sat in the doorway.</p>\n<p>And then, after weeks of this routine, always stopping at the threshold, he decided to come inside.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We had George put to sleep the year before. George had mega colon, a condition where the walls of the large intestine become weak, making it hard to pass stool normally. He had surgery to remove the affected section of his bowel, which bought him maybe a year before the disease progressed and he was too weak to eat or use the litter box, and we had to take him to the vet one last time.\u2028\nAnd then that day a year or so later that Leo decided to enter the house, he walked with purpose straight past three open doors and into the second bedroom and found the small basket of cat toys we hadn&rsquo;t been able to bear parting with, and Leo took out one of George&rsquo;s toys and began to play with it as if he had known it was there all along.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And then one night a week or so later, he didn&rsquo;t leave the house at the end of the night like usual. Instead, he walked straight over to one of the living room chairs, jumped up, curled into a ball and went to sleep. And my wife and I looked at each other and thought, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not leaving.&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And so he became part of our little family. He had no collar, and the vet said he had no microchip. We&rsquo;re not even sure how old he was.

				"content_text": "<em>He</em> adopted <em>us</em>. \n\nWe came around the side of our apartment building on Alki one early summer evening to find him on the walkway. He jumped three feet off the ground when I reached out to touch him, but he didn't run. He followed us up the stairs and stopped at the doorway, watching us for a while, chatting, until he wandered off to wherever he came from. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://stumax.micro.blog/uploads/2018/bcca15348e.jpg\" alt=\"Leo is not intimidated by the dog behind the fence\" title=\"DSCN3346.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"951\" height=\"636\" />\n\nAnd so it went for the next few weeks, us returning home, him on the walkway, following us up to the third floor and waiting at the doorway, never coming in, but hanging out on the landing to chat, getting head rubs, and occasionally even sitting on my lap, but only if I sat in the doorway. \n\nAnd then, after weeks of this routine, always stopping at the threshold, he decided to come inside. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://stumax.micro.blog/uploads/2018/3b67cc3e6a.jpg\" alt=\"Leo playing with tassles\" title=\"DSCN3347.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1136\" height=\"760\" />\n\nWe had George put to sleep the year before. George had mega colon, a condition where the walls of the large intestine become weak, making it hard to pass stool normally. He had surgery to remove the affected section of his bowel, which bought him maybe a year before the disease progressed and he was too weak to eat or use the litter box, and we had to take him to the vet one last time.\u2028\nAnd then that day a year or so later that Leo decided to enter the house, he walked with purpose straight past three open doors and into the second bedroom and found the small basket of cat toys we hadn't been able to bear parting with, and Leo took out one of George's toys and began to play with it as if he had known it was there all along. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://stumax.micro.blog/uploads/2018/115f6e9d80.jpg\" alt=\"Leo with his ball\" title=\"DSCN3359.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1136\" height=\"760\" />\n\nAnd then one night a week or so later, he didn't leave the house at the end of the night like usual. Instead, he walked straight over to one of the living room chairs, jumped up, curled into a ball and went to sleep. And my wife and I looked at each other and thought, \"He's not leaving.\"\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://stumax.micro.blog/uploads/2018/b8690e4f7a.jpg\" alt=\"Leo sleeping\" title=\"DSC_0485.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1504\" height=\"1000\" />\n\nAnd so he became part of our little family. He had no collar, and the vet said he had no microchip. We're not even sure how old he was. The vet speculated he had been abandoned or kicked out of his house or circumstances had changed such that he wanted to get away from home. This was not uncommon, he said.\n\nWe named him Leonardo, after DaVinci. He seemed intelligent and empathetic and occasionally stubborn, like an artist, so the name seemed to fit.  Later when we got Lucy as his companion and he acted like a cranky bachelor towards her, \"Leo\" seemed to fit him better. \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"http://stumax.micro.blog/uploads/2018/ee1f25bc23.jpg\" alt=\"Leo on the newspaper\" title=\"DSCN3890.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1136\" height=\"760\" />\n\nLeo liked to play, as all cats do, but mostly he liked to sit on our laps or lay on any blanket that covered our legs or bellies, which was a-ok with us.  We developed a routine, and Leo kept us to it. Saw us off to work in the morning, greeted us when we got home, rounded us up for bed and tucked us in.

He wanted to be on her lap or beside her the minute she would get home. Almost every night he would stand on her lap while she ate dinner, purring and just wanting to be close.

Pressing on an item and dragging didn’t work reliably and I needed to try several times to get it to drag properly. That problem seems to have cleared up, but I’m not sure if it was a system update or me changing my behavior that did it.</li>\n<li>Several programs were crashing whenever the Mac went to sleep, but the 10.12.3 update seems to have fixed that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n\nGripes aside, I just really love this new Mac. It feels solid and self-assured in every way. Moving to this from a 4-year-old Mac, I can definitely appreciate the constant refinement of features over the last few years. I wish the keyboard was a little deeper, but I’m not sure I want to trade that off for the extra thickness. I think the Touch Bar interactions could use some rethinking, but it’s got some real promise. Everything else, though, is beautiful and works like a charm. All things considered, I’ve got no regrets about getting this new Mac.\n",

				"content_text": "<p><em>The following is adapted from my opening remarks at <a href=\"http://worldiadayseattle.org/\">World IA Day Seattle 2016</a>, which took place on Saturday, February 20. The theme for World IA Day this year was: Information Everywhere, Architects Everywhere.</em></p>\n\n<p>If you've been around the information management world for any length of time, you've probably heard the joke about the old fish and the young fish. The old fish says \"Water's fine today\". And the young fish says, \"What's water?\"</p>\n\n<p>I didn't say it was a good joke.</p>\n\n<p>But it is useful as a shorthand for explaining something about what information is. We're like the fish, obviously, and information is all around us. We're swimming in it, but we don't even notice it until we learn to see it.</p>\n\n<p>How much information did you encounter last week? This morning? Since you started reading this? I'll bet you couldn't quantify the amount of information around you on any time scale. The room you're in is information, the street outside, the words you're reading, the clothes we're wearing... every sight, smell, sound, and surface carries information, and we process it all in an instant and without even noticing that we're doing it.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a universe of information. And most of the time we can, like the young fish, just swim in it and go about the business of being. But sometimes, we want to shape and form information into something intentional and meaningful, into a web site, an intranet, an app, a monument, or some other information experience. At those moments, when information is both the medium and the message, we must notice the information all around us and attempt to make it meaningful to ourselves and others. We must apply design. We must practice information architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I imagine a variation of the joke about the fish where in this version the old fish says to the young fish: \"I'm a fish.\" And the young fish says, \"What's a fish?\"</p>\n\n<p>It's still not a good joke.</p>\n\n<p>But I think we encounter something like this when we try to explain to our friends, family, colleagues, and bosses that we're information architects. When I tell someone I'm an information architect, I get something of a blank stare. For the longest time I tried to figure out how to break through that and come up with a cool way of explaining what I do (\"I'm like a ninja, but with information.\"), but I'm starting to lose hope that I'll come up with the right words.</p>\n\n<p>After all, everyone's something of an information architect. Everyone organizes something: closets, movie collections, garages, files on the computer, kitchens, bookshelves... you name it. We all try to impose some sort of order on the world, to create systems that make sense and keep on making sense, and impart some sort of meaning to others. We're all fish. I mean, we're all architects.</p>\n\n<p>It's just that, for those of us who are crazy enough to voluntarily identify ourselves as \"information architects\", we're doing more than organizing our spice racks or shoe closets. We are doing the same thing, essentially, except we're attempting to do it at scale. We're trying to impose order on thousands and millions of items of information at a time, for users who may number in millions or billions. And these days we're usually trying to do it within a window the size of an index card.</p>\n\n<p>And there's something so interesting about that to me. It seems like a fraught enterprise: doomed yet noble, and occasionally elegant and beautiful. There <em>is</em> information everywhere. And there <em>are</em> architects everywhere. But the rare breed who call themselves information architects are lucky enough to recognize these things; to understand that <em>this is water</em>, and <em>we are fish</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And to be able to know that is pretty damned cool.</p>\n",

Setting up systems and taxonomies can be daunting, especially because good organization schemes often don't reveal themselves until a certain critical mass of objects have been developed, at which point it often feels easier to just go with the ad hoc taxonomy that you started with. But it's worth spending some time to get your system in order. The productivity pay-off can be huge.</p>\n",

But companies and organizations are starting to realize the benefit of making the effort to organize around how <em>customers</em> think of the information domain.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But a couple of years ago Mike Mack, Syngenta’s CEO, took the bold decision to switch tack. He realised that while the previous organisational map made perfect sense to scientists, Syngenta’s customers – ie farmers – looked at the world with a different lens. Most notably, they did not usually wander into an agribusiness store and say: “I need fungicide.” Instead they just said: “I want to grow better rice.”</p>\n  \n  <p>So Mack reorganised the entire company into eight divisions defined by crops, not chemistry. Thus if you walk around the greenhouses, labs and offices near Windsor today as I recently did you will see chirpy labels saying “rice” – not “fungicide”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What would it mean to flip the taxonomy at your business?

Adapted by Frank Chimero from the talk he gave at the Build conference in November, 2013, <a href=\"http://frankchimero.com/talks/what-screens-want/transcript/\">What Screens Want</a> is an outstanding essay, both visually and conceptually. Ostensibly about responsive design and web and interaction design generally, the piece ends up getting at the heart of what this design is all about: making technology work better for humans. It's about how we're current trapped by a vision of the web that's about commerce and transactions and not at all about making the world a better place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We used to have a map of a frontier that could be anything. The web isn’t young anymore, though. It’s settled. It’s been prospected and picked through. Increasingly, it feels like we decided to pave the wilderness, turn it into a suburb, and build a mall. And I hate this map of the web, because it only describes a fraction of what it is and what’s possible. We’ve taken an opportunity for connection and distorted it to commodify attention. That’s one of the sleaziest things you can do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you care about creating a better internet, take the time to read What Screens Want. It's well worth it.</p>\n",

The main reason he gives for switching is that the simplicity of ithe Pad makes it hard for him to do productivity work, er, productively.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Apple has decided to make the iPad as simple as possible, but sometimes, this simplicity comes at the expense of power. Not having any kind of window management or split-screen view makes the iPad much easier to use, but it also means you can’t look at an email and at a Pages document at the same time. Preventing apps from interacting with each other cuts down on complexity, but it also means that it is difficult or sometimes even impossible to use multiple apps in conjunction on the same task. Not having any kind of system-level concept of a file or a document means that people are less likely to lose track of their files or documents, but it also means that you are often very limited in what you can do with the things you create in an iPad app.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Simplicity is a tricky thing to grapple with. What kind of simplicity are we talking about here? Simplicity in visual design? In a solution? Of a process? The iPad simplifies much of the cognitive overhead required to use a computing device. It simplifies app installation and upgrades, peripheral management (in that you don't need peripherals to use the iPad), battery management, connectivity, portability, app management, file storage, and lots of other aspects of computing. In doing so, it simultaneously makes some aspects of computing more complex.</p>\n\n<p>As Mathis points out, for some computing tasks where having access to two apps at the same time increases productivity, the iPad offers a less than ideal experience. If you need to do these kinds of tasks frequently, the iPad has not simplified them for you. In fact, it has made these kinds of tasks <em>more</em> complex, not less.</p>\n\n<p>Mathis's argument put me in mind of the trade offs I wrestle with when designing taxonomies and navigation. When designing navigation labels, shorter words and phrases are better, right? Well, not if they make it harder to understand the thing being labeled. Fewer choices in a navigation menu are better, right? Not if the things your customers are looking for are left out. A global header with two or three choices is simpler than one with 15, right? Not if you've made the customer click to find something they could have found previously at a glance, or if they never click because they simply assume you don't have what they're looking for.</p>\n\n<p>These trade offs often take the guise of aesthetic simplicity versus functional simplicity. These are not equivalent, though they are frequently conflated. Aesthetic simplicity removes buttons, decoration, text, and anything else that's visually superfluous. Functional simplicity removes steps in a process or cognitive overhead (the need to think intently about your interaction or experience). Both types of simplicity are desirable, but I believe that functional simplicity ultimately wins over more users than aesthetic simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>But the dimensions are a bit more complex than this simple dichotomy. Functional simplicity exists on a spectrum. What's simple to me may not be simple to you. This is somewhat analogous to the way experts tend to use more precise terms than laymen. It's simpler for horticulturists to communicate using correct Latin plant designations, for instance, than to try to struggle through the ambiguity using common names.</p>\n\n<p>For Mathis, the iPad isn't functionally simple. From his perspective, the Windows Surface — by allowing the use of two apps at once — is simpler than the iPad for his most important or frequent tasks. For me, the additional complexity of the Surface overall isn't worth trading my iPad to get a simpler experience for this particular use case.</p>\n\n<p>To each his own. Simplicity is in the eye of the beholder, and it's great that we have a choice of devices -- and terminology -- to meet our individual needs.</p>\n\n<p><small><em>Photo by Wade Morgen - [flic.kr/p/bDmwy4](http://flic.kr/p/bDmwy4)</em></small></p>\n",

But it's clear now that ADN's Twitter clone (alpha.app.net) is only a demonstration of one kind of app that can be built on the ADN infrastructure. ADN founder Dalton Caldwell believes his team is creating a personal cloud platform that will be home to a multitude of interesting services.</p>\n\n<p>It's still early days for App.net, but after poking around the service for the past few months and listening to a few podcasts where Caldwell has talked at length about what his team is trying to build, I'm convinced that ADN is something the VRM community should be paying more attention to.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the thing: ADN is not a true VRM service and it's not a true personal cloud service, but it bakes in some of the core elements of each. And the way the service is constructed is prompting its growing base of developers and users to think differently about their relationship to web services. And this new way of thinking could lead these users directly to true VRM and personal cloud services in the future.</p>\n\n<p>ADN could be an accelerator for VRM if the VRM community chooses to see it that way.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some data points I find interesting. See what you think:</p>\n\n<h2>Core Values</h2>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://app.net/about/\">ADN's core values</a>. The first two are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We are selling our product, NOT our users.</li>\n<li>You own your content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Right off the top, these values set ADN apart from services like Google, Twitter and Facebook, whose motives are more aligned with advertisers than with users.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the core values emphasize financial and philosophical alignment with members and developers. ADN is building a sustainable business that benefits when its users benefit.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy and Terms</h2>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://account.app.net/legal/terms/\">Terms of Service</a> and the <a href=\"https://account.app.net/legal/privacy/\">Privacy Policy</a>. Go ahead. Here's the thing: you can actually read them. They're short, written in straightforward language, and they're kept in a <a href=\"https://github.com/appdotnet/terms-of-service\">GitHub repository</a> so you can suggest changes. The App.net terms aren't perfect, but they're not bad and on the whole they're user-friendly.</p>\n\n<h2>Sounds like a personal cloud to me</h2>\n\n<p>ADN has defined a <a href=\"http://developers.app.net/docs/resources/file/\">File API</a> that allows each user free access to 20 GB of disk space for storing images, documents, or any other type of file. (The company has hinted that more storage may eventually be available for a price.) The benefit of storing your files on ADN is that you can allow them to be accessed by any service using the ADN API (what Lou Franco calls <a href=\"http://loufranco.com/blog/app-net-is-byobe-for-mobile\">BYOBE, or Bring-Your-Own-Back-End</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So, for instance, if you joined a Flickr-like photo sharing service that stored your photos in the ADN file store, you could switch to a competing ADN-enabled photo sharing service at any time and you wouldn't have to rebuild your photo library from scratch. You could just point the new service to your photos and keep on truckin'. Or use the two services side-by-side. It's up to you.</p>\n\n<p>While this would fail some tests of a true personal cloud (such as the ability to pick your own file server) what App.net offers within its service is personal cloud-like, and I'm not aware of any other popular web services that offer something similar.</p>\n\n<h2>Your data is your data</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to porting files from service to service, ADN allows <em>all</em> of your data to move freely via its API. That means your messages, your list of followers and who you follow, your list of interactions, and anything else that ADN stores can be reused by any app using the ADN API. Or, you can export your data and social graph and take them to another service.</p>\n\n<h2>Expressing intent with ADN</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://llama.adn.customwebapps.com\">Project Llama</a> wants to expand ADN's annotations so that users can tag their accounts with keywords that describe themselves and what they're looking for. So, for instance, I might tag myself as a \"hockey fan\" who is looking for \"Tampa Bay Lightning tickets\". I don't think Project Llama is thinking of itself as building a VRM-type expression of intent, but it's not to hard to see how it could become one.</p>\n\n<h2>Straight from the horse's mouth</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some recent podcasts where Dalton goes into detail about what he thinks ADN is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/13/\">The New Disruptors, Episode 13</a> with Glenn Fleishman</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/84\">The Big Web Show, Episode 84</a> with Jeffrey Zeldman</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2012/11/7/015-now-the-hard-work-begins-with-dalton-caldwell.html\">CMD+SPACE, Episode 15</a> with Myke Hurley</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>A big but…</h2>\n\n<p>My argument is not that App.net is a true VRM service or even a true personal cloud. For one thing, App.net isn't focused on enabling relationships with vendors outside of the ADN universe. For another, currently App.net is just a another silo. A true personal cloud service would be agnostic about where files or graphs are stored.</p>\n\n<p>However, Dalton Caldwell believes he's creating a personal cloud. And, certainly, with its emphasis on individual control of personal data, the aims and intentions of App.net echo the values espoused by the VRM community. And ADN is prompting developers to think differently about the types of apps they build and their relationship to user data in a way that makes true VRM solutions a more obvious next step. And that is something that the VRM community -- that all of us -- should be celebrating and supporting.</p>\n\n<p>I'm <a href=\"https://alpha.app.net/stumax\">@stumax on App.net</a>.

Assertions distinguish between real-world things and the documents that refer to them.</p>\n\n<p>Experts map the world, users mark points of interest.</p>\n\n<p>Modeling begins with research, talking to experts and users to understand and articulate the subject. Ubiquitous language describes the granular terms that will be used by everyone on the project. Boundary objects show where your subject model can connect to neighboring models.</p>\n\n<p>Content is hard.</p>\n\n<p>Everything starts with good content.

Unfortunately, EA has taken the air out of the tires of Real Racing 3’s lightning quick gameplay, effectively turning one of the best iOS games on the market into a frustrating, stop-and-go test on your patience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love racing games and have enjoyed the Real Racing franchise. I downloaded Real Racing 3 as soon as it was available, but became disenchanted pretty quickly with the micro-transaction model that makes you either wait several minutes for upgrades and repairs or buy coins to proceed without delay.  I deleted the app yesterday because it just wasn't fun to play the game under that kind of business model.</p>\n\n<p>Real Racing 3 is a good game, and EA could charge a fair price for the complete experience. I wish they would.</p>\n",

Why isn’t the catalyst for a new category or disruption put forward by another company? More precisely, why isn’t there another company which consistently re-defines categories and repeatedly, predictably even, re-defines how technology is used.</p>\n  \n  <p>Put another way: Why is it that everyone wants to copy Apple’s products but nobody wants to copy being Apple?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like Horace's analysis, as usual, but I do think there's something to what Tim Cook says about innovation being in the DNA at Apple. The movements of a company reflect the attitudes and actions of leadership. Lots of leaders can't get past the inertia of even well-meaning people to stay the course and keep doing today what they did yesterday. In those companies, change only happens in small increments. At Apple, Steve Jobs got to basically rebuild Apple from the ground up, to infuse the company with exactly the culture he wanted. That's why what Apple does is so had to copy.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>So I'm a <em>wee</em> bit late posting this, but I was working on a poster presentation for this year's IA Summit when I came across the notes I took for my presentation at InfoCamp Seattle 2012. It's now posted here for internet posterity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.turninggrille.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/InfoCamp-intro-to-VRM.pdf\">InfoCamp intro to VRM</a> (PDF)</p>\n\n<p>I thought this might be interesting for two reasons. First, I think the central message of the presentation is still relevant: information management professionals should be at the forefront of thinking about how people identify, store, and manage their own data in a VRM-enabled world. The PDF roughs out the main ideas of VRM and suggests how information management professionals might contribute to this emerging movement.</p>\n\n<p>(Update 3-22-13: Holy smokes! I didn't realize that Tracy Wolfe, the Mod Librarian, <a href=\"http://modlibrarian.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/infocampsea-what-is-vrm/\">posted a nice writeup of this presentation</a> back in October. I really need to start paying attention to this whole internet thing. I hear it's really taking off.)</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, (and a bit more prosaically) I drafted these notes in <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=20583&sid=a65d7d0c5d43f57ef36ac3345ed2affb\">Scapple</a>, an awfully interesting brainstorming program under development at <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com\">Literature and Latte</a> (the fine folks who make <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a>). Scapple basically lets you enter free-form bits of text on a canvas of whatever size you choose. You can move the bits around to regroup them, and you can drag one text bit over another to relate the two with a dotted line. It was truly one of the best brainstorming experiences I've had on a computer. I ended up using the Scapple document as both my presenter notes and my presentation slide.</p>\n\n<p>If you're like me and you're really not into the linear process of outlining, but you still want to do something like outlining on a computer, I encourage you to give Scapple a try. It's free for a limited time while in Beta. But watch out: you might get hooked.</p>\n",

I want the links to work <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/\">Daring Fireball</a>-style, where I write a pithy comment and the post title takes you to the link in question. I also want it to be easy to post from my iPad, especially from <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poster-wordpress-blog-editor/id549006481?mt=8\">Poster</a> by way of <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8\">Mr. Reader</a>. And I want to be able to do this using an off-the-shelf theme, rather than spending a lot of time developing my own.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I haven't found the magic formula to make all that happen seamlessly.</p>\n\n<p>There are tumblog themes for WordPress, but none of them have the elegant visual style that I'm looking for. Moreover, most of them seem to use custom post types that require you to be in the WP dashboard in order to complete your post, making Poster useless for this kind of workflow.</p>\n\n<p>So here's what I'm doing currently. If you read this and have any suggestions on how I can make this easier, I am all ears.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently using the <a href=\"http://www.themezilla.com/themes/launch/\">Launch</a> theme from Themezilla. I like the clean look and the distinct styles of each of the custom posts. However, I don't like the implementation of all of the custom post types, and it doesn't work for me to log into the dashboard every time I want to post a link from my iPad. So, I created a child theme and updated a couple of the custom post types more to my liking. The link and video types now let me add a comment in addition to the link.</p>\n\n<p>The video post type now lets me use WordPress's <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">native embed shortcode</a> to add YouTube and Vimeo videos, among others. This is still a little kludgy, though, because I need to click through to the video on YouTube in order to get the link to the video. Then I need to create a new Poster blog post and enter the URL for YouTube inside the embed short code. Not as elegant as just clicking a link from Mr. Reader, but it works.</p>\n\n<p>I'm using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/daring-fireball-linked-list/\">Daring Fireball-style Linked List</a> plugin to enable link post types. This plug-in uses a custom field for adding a link, a method that is well supported by Poster, so it's fairly easy to add a link directly from Mr. Reader on my iPad, as long as I remember to copy the link to the iPad's clipboard before I start drafting my post.</p>\n\n<p>I now have an iPad posting workflow that's not as elegant and streamlined as I might like, but it's not horrible either. I'm sure I could make my life a lot easier if I just broke down and used Tumblr (as I used to do), but I don't like the fact that I can't export my posts from their service. I'm tired of silos, and I really want to host my own content. I guess in exchange, though, I have to give up a little bit of the ease that some other services provide.</p>\n\n<p>Postscript: I be remiss if I didn't mention the <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/02/15/bye-posterous\">sunsetting of Posterous</a>. Posterous was an excellent blogging service before it was bought by Twitter, and I'm sad to see it go. If it had stayed an independent entity, I might still be using it. The way that it handled different types of input -- like letting you just paste a link to a video, image, or audio file and then publishing the linked item in the right format -- was pretty slick.</p>\n",

From its earliest point in being, the bike would be able to keep track of data about itself, things like its specifications, when it was made, and even the provenance of the materials used in its manufacture. The bike would keep track of inventory data like when it was delivered to the bike shop, who assembled it, its price, and when it was bought and by who.\n  And all this would be possible with a personal cloud for a bike.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Phil's vision could be accomplished without an on-board bike computer, it's hard to imagine a truly useful fire-and-forget system without one, or without a connected infrastructure at the important points of presence: the manufacturer, the store, the bike shop, etc. But this sort of automated administration would be useful for all sorts of things, and I don't see any technical hurdles standing in the way.

Gregg Taylor's audio drama about the adventures of Jack Justice and Trixie Dixon, Girl Detective, is as entertaining as they come, full of smart, funny dialog and all the usual murder, intrigue, and action you'd expect from a hard-boiled detective series.</p>\n\n<p>Taylor's new paperback, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466290862/\">Black Jack Justice</a></em>, is the story of how Jack and Trixie first met, and the book won't disappoint either fans of the podcast or the uninitiated reader looking for some good old-fashioned escapist entertainment. <em>Justice</em> is a cracking read; the characters are well-defined, the banter is witty, and the tension ebbs and flows at a pace that keeps the reader engaged throughout. Taylor's writing isn't just an homage to pulp fiction, it shows him as a true peer of the masters of the genre.</p>\n\n<p><em>(This post originally appeared on The Machine That Goes Ping.)</em></p>\n",

There's much to like: It's beautiful, a gorgeous and gritty recreation of London of the late 1800s. The script is clever. It's got plenty of action. It's got Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes, and the script retains enough of the character and qualities of the Sherlock Holmes stories to satisfy the casual fan of the legendary detective.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand... it's Sherlock Holmes as an action movie. Which is just... odd. It's a little bit Batman and Robin meets James Bond with some Indiana Jones supernatural sorcery plot lines thrown in for good measure.</p>\n\n<p>The movie suffers from detachment. Having knocked the stodgy and clichéd vision of Holmes off its pedestal, the film never firmly roots him in a new milieu. We know we're supposed to be affected by the fact that Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is moving out of 221B Baker Street to get married (and presumably won't be accompanying Holmes on his adventures any more), but that tension is treated almost casually; Holmes doesn't seem truly moved by that upheaval in his life (nor does Watson), so why should we care? The chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. never quite gels. Some of the situations stretch credulity, such as when we see Holmes improvise his way into a disguise and manufacture a \"chance encounter\" with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) and her mysterious employer.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, for all that, Sherlock Holmes is enjoyable and engaging, and I've certainly seen movies worse than this. It's a comic book movie (literally... based on a comic book treatment of Holmes), and that cuts both ways: the comic book sensibility carried out well (as it is here by director Guy Ritchie) makes for great escapism. But it also feels a bit hollow and superficial. We want more for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective than to see him reduced to being just another action-adventure hero.</p>\n\n<p><em>(This post originally appeared on The Machine That Goes Ping.)</em></p>\n",

Good story, decent acting, great effects. But as I watched it I was kind of thinking to myself that I'm tired of the modern action flick schtick. You know, where there's just this predictable cadence of violence and motion and effects stitched together with just enough story elements to make it appealing to a broad audience. I wanted to watch something that took its time and developed characters and situations I could genuinely invest in emotionally.</p>\n\n<p>Moneyball, surprisingly, is exactly that movie.</p>\n\n<p>I say surprisingly mostly because I read the first couple of chapters of Michael Lewis's book of the same name, about Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and his attempt to change the way baseball players are recruited with the help of Peter Brand, a young economist from Yale. The book is very well written, and I'm looking forward to finishing it... but it's not a movie. What's surprising is that writers Stan Chervin (story), Steven Zaillian, and Aaron Sorkin (screenplay) turned the raw material of Lewis's non-fiction book into an engrossing, touching, and inspiring film. The best film about baseball at least since Bull Durham, but also plain and simply an excellent film.</p>\n\n<p>Director Bennett Miller and Director of Photography Wally Pfister create a palpable sense of being in the back rooms of baseball, of being present with Beane as he struggles to chip away at baseball's long-held traditions. The movie's pacing is perfect, and the acting is outstanding. Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt, in particular, deliver first-rate performances.</p>\n\n<p>You don't have to love baseball to like this movie. Watch it to see the craft of filmmaking at its best. And, if you need a little inspiration – if you like seeing a risk-taker, an innovator, take on the status quo and make a dent in the universe – you'll be richly rewarded by spending a couple hours watching Moneyball.</p>\n\n<p><em>(This post originally appeared on The Machine That Goes Ping.)</em></p>\n",

In each, she gives some historical background, followed by practical rules for applying each element of typography. For instance, in the Letter section, we learn about the development of metal typefaces and their evolution from shapes that emulated the marks that people naturally made on a page, to shapes that were more clearly machine-produced, to those that were created in response to the constraints of digital displays. Lupton then teaches us how to identify parts of a font, how to think about size and scale, how to mix typefaces and how to work with fonts on a screen.</p>\n\n<p>thinking with type is a very readable book, very well written, and beautifully rendered.

				"content_text": "<p>I've been invited to join Google+, but every time I try to join I get the message that Google has \"temporarily exceeded our capacity.\" So fine. I'll be patient.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, I've been reading up on the service. The most fascinating part of it to me is Google Circles, a kind of proto-VRM social graph management feature. Circles lets you define relationships between your contacts so that you can tune your messages and sharing appropriately. Maybe you want to share your pictures of your kids with grandma and grandpa, but not with your drinking buddies. Circles helps you keep those groups straight.</p>\n\n<p>On this week's <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/24\">Hypercritical podcast</a>, John Siracusa pointed out one potential problem with this feature: the interface is cute and effective for groups of 12 or less, but a bit unwieldy for the larger circles of dozens or hundreds you might want to put together for, say, professional networking.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_plus_circle_system_may_not_be_sustainable.php\">Sarah Perez at ReadWriteWeb</a> points out another important usability issue with Circles (and, by extension, any relationship management application): administrative overhead. She points out that your relationships with people may change over time due to things like changing jobs. The group of people that yesterday you categorized as \"work colleagues\" are today \"acquaintances\", or something similar.</p>\n\n<p>Or, as Perez says, virtual relationships can become real, as when we meet someone we've been following on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>But what about when one of those people becomes a real-world friend? Maybe you first run into them at a conference, putting a face to a name. They're now an \"Acquaintance.\" Later, you spend a night out on the town with them, and realize you have a lot in common. You make plans to see each other again, at a non-work event, perhaps. This person has become a \"Friend.\" Depending on how your Google Circles are set up, you may have had to drag-and-drop them into multiple different circles over time, as this relationship changes.</blockquote>\n\n<p>How many people do you have in your address book? Let's say your Google+ Circles include the 150 people that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number\">Dunbar</a> says we can maintain stable social relationships with. How much time do you think it would take you to review each of them and make sure that they're organized into the right groups in Circles? And how often would you have to look at that list to make updates? And what if you were to add in people on the fringes - people you might be acquainted with, but don't interact with on a regular basis?</p>\n\n<p>This administrative overhead would be a deal killer for most normal humans. Very few people will want to take the time to maintain this relationship graph on a regular basis. If you're, say, a real estate agent, keeping up with your contact list is a critical business activity. But when you're off the clock, personal contact administration is just a chore, and ignoring that chore can have consequences. If the tools you use to interact online expect you to have a continually pruned and up-to-date relationship graph, the risk of exposing information to the wrong group of people is higher when you don't meet that expectation.</p>\n\n<p>The implication of this observation is that either the tools have to do a lot more to help you manage these changing relationships automatically - perhaps by analyzing where you are, who you're with, and what sort of messages you send via email, twitter, IM, etc. - or our personal relationship management tools are going to remain very simple for the foreseeable future.  I suspect the latter is the case. Without having seen it myself, I suspect that Google+ Circles represents the outer edge of what people are willing to do to maintain relationships online. If that's true, then anything that depends on exploiting your social graph will have some built-in limitations that will be very hard to get around.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Proponents of VRM and the Personal Data Ecosystem are facing an uphill battle. In order to move the locus of power away from organizational interests and towards individual interests, the architects of this new space will need to break two very powerful dependencies: corporations' dependency on the income derived from capturing and reusing their users' data, and individuals' dependency on the free or nearly free services that they get in exchange for giving up that data. These two forces form a kind of magnetic attraction to each other, one that won't easily be broken.</p>\n\n<p>This point was driven home to me by <a href=\"http://ianwilker.com/rootslab/?p=409\">this excellent post</a> from Ian Wilker about Sam Harrelson, who deleted his Facebook, Google, and Twitter accounts back in November and <a href=\"http://samharrelson.me/2010/11/04/how-to-kill-twitter\">wrote this about why he did so</a>:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>I don’t blame them. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple etc are corporations. Corporations are inherently out for themselves and their stock holders. I blame myself for falling into the trap of shiny and nifty free/freemium services in exchange for my data and my online identity. I want my children and students to grow up in an era that includes an open web that isn’t based on advertising or 3rd party cookie data mining.</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>There are few of us who are as committed to the idea of breaking our dependency on these services as Sam is. I can't do it. I might be able to live without Twitter at this point. I've walked up to the line of deleting my Facebook account, but can't pull the trigger. Google is just a bridge too far for me. No way can I replace the convenience of Gmail.</p>\n\n<p>And the punchline is that even Sam can't completely leave Twitter. In a comment to his own post on leaving these services, he writes:</p>\n\n<p><blockquote>Oddly enough (or not), my 8th graders have been on my case constantly about my Twitter sojourn. So, I'm using the @GriffinScience account as my \"teacher\"/personal account to keep in contact with the students who rely on their Twitter stream pretty heavily (growing number and I want to encourage their exploration).</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>Online services like Twtter, Facebook, et al, have become so embedded in our lives that, lacking alternatives, we are left with two painful choices to make: either 1) continue to use these web services and pay the price by contributing to the erosion of our privacy and control, or 2) give up these services and cut ourselves off from a vibrant online society and a powerful set of communication tools.</p>\n\n<p>We need other choices to make. Organizations need alternative ways to make a profit other than capturing and storing user data. Individuals need low-cost, high-value services that come with tools to control the movement and use of their personal data. </p>\n\n<p>But new services that offer these choices will need to overcome the strong symbiotic bond that currently exists between users and the current set of services. Personal Data service providers will need to offer alternatives that look a lot like the current options and that provide similar levels of utility, while also providing the extra features that move the balance of control back towards individuals. Like Nicorette for smokers or methadone for heroin addicts, Personal Data services need to satisfy current cravings while simultaneously replacing them with something healthier. And that, while not impossible, is going to be a challenge.</p>\n",

One bit of learning from that venture has been about the energy commitment in the early part of a project.  It's like having a full time job, which would be easy if we didn't already have full time jobs.</li>\n    <li>I spend whatever spare minutes I have maintaining <a href=\"http://thelouvertureproject.org/wiki\">The Louverture Project</a>.  The wiki has really grown by leaps and bounds lately, thanks to some energetic contributors.</li>\n    <li>I've also got another project in the works that I hope to be able to announce soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm busy.</p>\n\n<p>This blog has served me well, but I can no longer serve it well.  I might occasionally write a post or two at <a href=\"http://sufferableass.com\">The Sufferable Ass</a>.  I started that blog in order to learn Wordpress, and to experiment with a replacement to Stumax.com.  Unfortunately, having a different blog doesn't make time magically appear, so posting there has been and will probably remain light.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who has dropped by over the years that this blog has been up and running.  This has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience, and I hope to see you all elsewhere in the blogosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time...</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This blog is dying. This is as apparent to me as it is to anyone who may be reading it. Frankly, I'll be surprised if anyone reads <em>this</em>. In fact, why <strong>are</strong> you still looking here? Don't you have better blogs to be paying your valuable <a href=\"http://attentiontrust.org/\">attention</a> to?</p>\n\n<p>Frankly, I haven't been able to figure out what to do with Stumax.com. <a href=\"http://delicious.com/stumax\">Del.icio.us</a> has taken over the burden of keeping all the random links I come across, so I don't feel the need to track them here so much. I'm spending energy on <a href=\"http://seattlerealestatetalk.com/\">Seattle Real Estate Talk</a>, <a href=\"http://thelouvertureproject.org/wiki\">The Louverture Project</a>, and a new venture with <a href=\"http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/\">Lloyd</a>. On top of a full-time job and the recently completed efforts for <a href=\"http://seattlemind.com\">Seattle Mind Camp</a> (which was a lot of fun, and, I think, something of a success), I'm just not finding a lot of spare time to write.</p>\n\n<p>Nor am I really sure what to write about here. This blog has been an interesting learning experience, but it became something that didn't quite look like me. I vented a lot about politics and society and stuff -- which is certainly part of what I think about -- but I never really felt that I matched in this blog the voice I feel I really have -- the sardonic, silly, irreverent sense of humor that I prefer to display in my best hours. Plus, my attention and interests wax and wane often enough that this place never really looked cohesive to me.</p>\n\n<p>So, huh. What to do?</p>\n\n<p>Well, I think the blog will stay around for a while, but it needs a re-invention, and that's something I just don't have time or energy to contemplate right now. In the meantime, I've discovered this cool new site called <a href=\"http://suprglu.com/\">SuprGlu</a>. SuprGlu attempts to combine a user's efforts from a variety of sources on a single page. So, my <a href=\"http://delicious.com/stumax\">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stumax/\">Flickr</a> photos, <a href=\"http://www.43things.com/person/stumax\">43 Things</a> things, and my various blogs' posts all show up in a single feed. So until and unless I get motivated to reconstruct Stumax.com in my image and likeness, the best way to keep up with me is on <a href=\"http://stumax.suprglu.com/\">this page at SuprGlu</a>. (And <a href=\"http://stumax.suprglu.com/feed/rss20/supr.xml\">here's the RSS feed</a>, if you're so inclined.)</p>\n\n<p><em>(By the by, this SuprGlu thing manages to take a step towards an idea I've been thinking a lot about recently: the idea of \"inventory.\" There are lots of places on the web and elsewhere where one can put one's data (if one wishes), but it can be hard to remember where it all is, or to keep others apprised of its whereabouts. Not all of my friends are very technically inclined, so telling them to check out my Flickr feed or Del.icio.us bookmarks -- on top of all the other URLs I've given them -- is kind of pointless. They simply won't track them. </p> \n(Much in the way the </em></em><a href=\"http://attentiontrust.org/\">Attention Trust</a>** is trying to raise awareness about the notion of gestures of attention, I think we need a better way to inventory all the data we have online. In fact, if we solved the three essential issues of the modern web -- identity, attention, and inventory -- we'd be some happy campers.)*</p>\n\n<p>Well, okay, so that's it from here for now. I'll probably add a post here on occasion. Or more often. Or less. Who knows? But I'm still active online, and I wanted you to know where to find me.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nI am lucky enough to have met Robert A. Moog, the engineer who changed the world with his eponymous synthesizers.  I was 12 years old, or thereabouts, attending a kind of science and technology camp at Western Carolina University.  Bob Moog lived in nearby Asheville, and invited our class to his house for a tour of his workshop.  I was too young to appreciate who I was meeting at the time, but Moog's enthusiasm and love for technology and music won me over, and I certainly have never forgot -- nor ever will forget -- the time spent in his presence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI had spent most of my first week at camp playing with a sound generator.  The thing was a monster and looked and worked like an old telephone switch board.  To get the sound, you would use patch cables to hook up different tone generators, and then tweak the switches and dials to get the desired effect.  The process was crude and cumbersome, and the output wasn't impressive by any means, but to a curious young geek it was an absorbing pursuit.  Little did I know that I would soon meet the man who had consigned beasts like this to the scrap heap, and had enabled a generation of musicians to explore and extend music in ways no one had dreamed possible.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI remember Moog as kind, gracious, funny, and charming,  We toured his workspace, <em>oohing</em> and <em>aahing</em> over vintage synthesizers and getting a sneak peek at a <a href=\"http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/fairlight/\">Fairlight CMI</a>, a powerful new type of computerized synth with dual 8-bit processors and a green monochrome screen.  I think that he and I talked about my adventures with the beast back at the college, but I can't be sure that I wasn't merely tongue-tied and shy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI do remember that Moog was gregarious and garrulous, conducting the tour himself with an unmistakable enthusiasm for his work.  We ended up sitting on his porch eating cookies and drinking lemonade while his wife showed off some treasured memorabilia, including some early albums recorded with Moog synthesizers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/08/22/moog.obit.ap/index.html\">Bob Moog died Sunday</a> of a brain tumor at his home in Asheville.  He was 71.  His inventions paved the way for the kind of creative tools that I take for granted today.  His work enabled and inspired the musicians that wrote the soundtrack to my youth.  And, personally, he was a really cool guy.  May he rest in peace and be ever remembered.\n</p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags start -->\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Moog\" rel=\"tag\">Moog</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Music\" rel=\"tag\">Music</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Remembrance\" rel=\"tag\">Remembrance</a></p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags end -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nSo I left a brief comment at <a href=\"http://thecoolkids.us/coffee/\">Lloyd's coffee blog</a> pleading with him to never buy anything from Best Buy.  He asked, of course, the obvious follow-up: \"Why not?\"  Since \"Because\" just didn't seem to quite capture the nuances of my objections to that foul retailer, I thought I'd take a moment to explain my position.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow, I'm well aware that one can Google the word \"hate\" AND [any store or service provider] and find blog posts, forum rants, and even whole websites full of venom.  But Best Buy seems to work diligently at finding new and ever-stupider ways to lower the bar of customer service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTake the guy who got <a href=\"http://lonestartimes.com/index.php?p=495\">arrested when he tried to pay</a> an installation charge in $2 bills (<a href=\"http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43685\">see here, too</a>).  And did you know that <a href=\"http://columbus.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2004/08/16/daily22.html\">the company is being sued</a> by the Ohio State Attorney General's office for hundreds of reports of \"unfair and deceptive acts,\" such as repackaging used goods as new, and failing to honor rebates and extended service contracts?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMistakes happen, right?  Well, actually, Best Buy has <a href=\"http://revjim.net/item/10173/\">openly declared their desire</a> to <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/07/05/national1332EDT0564.DTL\">weed out unprofitable customers</a> (whom they call \"devils\" -- how charming!) from profitable customers, or \"angels.\"   Best Buy seems to think that customers who take advantage of specials, rebates, and loss-leaders are stealing from the company.  Moreover, to weed out the riff-raff, Best Buy secretly collects data on customer shopping habits and uses that data to discourage repeat visits.  Best Buy wants to identify their best consumers and treat the rest of us as second-class citizens.  Fine.  Please yourselves.  But don't expect your attitude to make me want to do business with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy frustration with Best Buy goes way back.  They opened their first store in Orlando in the mid-90s, and from the beginning I had trouble just finding prices on the things I wanted to buy.  There were no prices on the boxes, and the shelf labels were maintained haphazardly.  The seemingly perpetual problem with maintaining appropriate staffing levels meant that I wasted gobs of time just trying to determine whether I was going to buy something from them or not.  When I could get someone's attention, they were rude or abrupt.  From the high-decibel noise assault to the disorganized shelves to the surly staff, the whole place exuded an air of cynicism and disdain for the customers that was beyond the pale, and I have seen the same pattern repeated consistently in each Best Buy I've entered.   My reaction was no doubt due in part to working 50-60 hours a week in the hospitality industry at companies who set the standard for good customer service.  I'm well aware that there's a better way to behave as a retailer and it isn't hard.  It just takes determination and effort.  Pissing off your consumers is simply not acceptable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLook, nobody deserves to get ripped off -- Best Buy included.  But most retailers take the approach that customers are basically honest.  Those are the companies I want to deal with.   I don't want to give my money to any company that doesn't even seem willing to pretend to make their customers -- not their profits -- the most important element of their business.  My money and my time are valuable, and if Best Buy doesn't want to treat me with respect, they don't get to have me as a customer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you need more reasons to hate Best Buy, head over to <a href=\"http://www.bestbuysux.org/\">BestBuySux.org</a>.  They've kept an archive of comments - both pro and con - about the retailer since 1999.\n</p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags start -->\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;font-size:10px;\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/customerservice\" rel=\"tag\">customerservice</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/rants\" rel=\"tag\">rants</a></p>\n\n<!-- technorati tags end -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\nGnomedex was amazing, and Saturday was a particularly rewarding day.  Take <a href=\"http://www.julieleung.com\">Julie Leung</a>'s talk, for starters.  She inspired me to do more than think of my blog as a place to dump text.  I want to learn to treat this space with more respect, thought, and care.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt lunch, I sat next to <a href=\"http://www.ericrice.com\">Eric Rice</a>, who talked about how blogs are failing him; this was a revelation.  Blogs are conversations, truly, and the problem of how to manage your reader's experience, how to direct them and give them a structure for understanding your content when they may be stepping into the middle of a conversation... this problem is no small thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://evelynrodriguez.typepad.com/\">Evelyn Rodriguez</a> was sitting next to Eric, and she and I ended up in an extended and wide ranging conversation which touched on a lot of ideas and feelings that I haven't thought about for a while:  the work of Joseph Campbell, following your passion, answering the call, bringing heart and soul and humanity back into business...  Evelyn taught me about the Jonah complex, and the concept of post-traumatic growth.  We talked far past lunch and I ended up missing at least two conference sessions, but I wouldn't have traded our time for anything.  I have seen Evelyn's name many times in several of the blogs I really like, and I had not taken the time to sample her writing.  I'm just digging in now, and finding how much this incredible person has to offer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.curry.com/\">Adam Curry</a>'s keynote touched on similar themes, on the idea that what the new technology is enabling is for people to express their passion, to bypass TV and radio's \"hitmaker syndrome\" and to become a place where people can advocate for the things they love.  He called on users and developers to keep pushing, to try on each other's perspectives and work together to get this new media revolution in full swing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe whole weekend was about passion, in the end.  Gnomedex 5.0 was full of people who are passionate about what they do.  They are unwilling to accept the status quo.  They need to move things forward, to make a change in the world, to evolve.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe most incredible thing was how... for the most part... ego-less the whole place seemed.  The attendees seemed to revel in each others' presence.  They wanted to learn from each other, and they wanted to share what they knew without restriction, as if they realized that the only way they could grow as individuals was to grow as a community.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPerhaps I'm romanticizing things a bit.  I'm still being rocked by the waves of energy, still swirling in that whirlpool of motion, so perhaps I'm not entirely clear-headed, but there's no doubt that something amazing happened this weekend.  I bumped into <a href=\"http://syndic8.com/\">Jeff Barr</a> on the way to my car on Saturday night.  He's got a million times more juice in the community that I do, and he was buzzing as much as I was.  He said, \"No matter what you do, what these other guys in the room are doing is 20 times cooler.\"  Everyone seemed to feel that respect and awe for each other.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor me, personally, this weekend was a significant experience.  About a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.stumax.com/archives/000394.php\" title=\"I blogged about\">I blogged about</a> a post that <a href=\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000908.html\">Hugh MacLeod wrote</a>.  In it, Hugh said, \"the old ways are dead, and you need people around you who concur.\"  Back then, I wrote that \"people who think the world is changing surround themselves with people who think the world is changing... these people change the world.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI've been searching ever since that day to find the people who concur that the old ways are dead.  Wonder of wonders, I found them at Gnomedex.\n</p>\n",

Maybe Microsoft understands how they're viewed in the world and have a healthy sense of humor about it.  Maybe.  Maybe it just kind of looks that way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe're the first public audience to see IE 7.  First impressions:  it looks a lot like Firefox.  Of course, it's not finished yet.  Things will move around.  Really, how original can you get with a browser?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo IE can automatically sniff RSS and view it in the browser.  Their RSS view looks EXACTLY like Safari's.  Hmmmm...\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMaybe I'm being a little unfair, but what these guys are talking isn't that big a deal.  I'm doing the same stuff on the Mac and I'm doing it now, not at the end of 2006.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo here's the key insight from Microsoft.  All applications should natively understand what a \"subscription\" means and know how to deal with it.  I think this is right on.  Downloading will be done at the platform level, meaning applications will make a call to the built-in downloading service to get feeds, enclosures, etc.  Applications will dip into this pool, or stream, of data.  To the user, it's a seamless experience.  Very cool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere's a little hostility towards the MS guys from the crowd, particularly from one Mac guy.  I don't think contention is the right tactic to engage the MS guy, but there is a little bit of an attitude that's being presented by MS that they're doing something really cool and forward-thinking, when it looks to many of us that they're really just catching up.  I think the hostility might be coming from the attitude that they're telling us something new.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere's the problem:  Microsoft looks like they're not really aware of what state of the art technology looks like.  They look like they're behind the curve.  They'd be better off, in my opinion, acknowledging what's already available to bleeding edge techno-nerds, and start explaining how they're going to make it bigger, better, and available to more folks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMS will be making their RSS extension specs available under Creative Commons.  Very, very cool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNote to Dean, if, as you said, you're interested in starting conversations, you're going to have to participate in them, not shut down people who are poking at you.  You look defensive.  Not that I'd want to be up there in your place, but you have to recognize that the hostility is part of the conversation.  You can't just pretend it will go away.  You have to listen deeply, figure out what people are hostile about, and respond to that.  You're shutting people down, but you need these folks, at the end of the day, to work with you.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMicrosoft has a PR problem.  In terms of how they're presenting themselves to their public, they're trotting out these scrubbed, clean-cut, Disney-esque, passive-agressive pretty boys to sell their products (and I think that this is kind of they way they act in the world -- clean cut, coy, but they might just pull a fast one on you.)  What they need is a fighter, a passionate advocate.  Someone who thrives in the hostility, can see the other side, and can really engage.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey need to clone Scoble.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n---\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSteve Rubel says, \"This is Embrace and Extend Lite (tm).\"  In other words, it's a good start, but we're not convinced.\n</p>\n",

The house was packed with a hardcore geek crowd.  I remember thinking that half of these guys -- overweight and pony-tailed -- could be models for the comic book store owner in The Simpsons.  Personally, I love this.  It was nice to watch a movie like H2G2 with a truly appreciative crowd.  When \"For Douglas\" flashed on the screen at the end of the movie, the audience let out a heartfelt cheer.</li>\n<li> I thought I was the only one pissed at George Lucas.  Guess not.  When the trailer for Episode III came on, there were equal parts cheering and booing, and one very loud, \"You suck, George Lucas!\" from the gentleman in front of us.  Hope you sell a lot of toys, George.</li>\n<li> My wife has not read the books and enjoyed the film.  And why not?  Who wouldn't love Sam Rockwell and Alan Rickman?</li>\n<li> As a long-time Douglas Adams fan, I found lots to enjoy, but also many filmmaking decisions that puzzled and frustrated me.  It's no wonder that the film took so long to get produced, because Hitchhikers is in no way the stuff of standard Hollywood fare.  It's meandering, philosophical, and a bit wistful.  And damn funny.  It's not a love story, and I think that by trying to make it one, the story lost its center.</li>\n<li> If you're a real fan, I'm not sure what you'll gain by seeing the movie.  The radio and tv series were much better adaptations.  In fact, I'm not even sure what the big deal is about making any great book into a movie.  The two media are completely different, and so much has to be lost in the translation from the page to the screen.  It's kind of like saying, \"Hey, you like pizza?  Well you're going to love this pizza-flavored corn chip.\"  I might, but it's not the same thing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nThere was a lovely <a href=\"http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/607/607319p1.html\">tribute to Douglas Adams from the folks at IGN FilmForce</a>.

				"content_text": "<p>\nI drafted a post a while ago on this topic, but I've never quite finished it.  I think the impulse behind it is good, so I submit the idea for your consideration:\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBush has been fond of talking about the \"<a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/1/9/110923.shtml\">soft bigotry of low expectations</a>.\"  (You know, in a bad way; he's against it.)  But of course, he takes every opportunity to shed criticism or be held to any standard of accountability.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt's too late now, alas, but at some point during the debates I wish John Kerry had kind of explicitly called Bush out on this.  Like, \"I know that you were handed a recession and then 9/11 happened so you lost a million jobs on your watch, but I expect my Presidents to overcome such difficulties and implement effective plans to meet these unexpected challenges.  To accept that you shouldn't have handled the economy any differently would be to engage in the soft bigotry of low expectations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOr, \"You told us that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there weren't.  You told us that Osama bin Ladena and Sadaam Hussein were in cahoots; they weren't.  You told us that this war would cost $30 billion; it is projected to cost upwards of $200 billion.  You told us that Osama bin Laden can run but he can't hide, yet he is still on the loose. To accept that we shouldn't have to trust the word of our President would be to engage in the soft bigotry of low expectations.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou get the idea.  I wish Kerry had used that line.  I wish he'd reminded us more explicitly that we hold our Presidents to a higher standard.  That's all.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>\n<a href=\"http://rhetorica.net/archives/002711.html\">Andrew Cline at Rhetorica</a> writes:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nLast week I began to notice the assertion \"everything changed on 9/11\"--especially as preceded by the ad populum fallacy \"everyone knows.\" I say \"began to notice\" because up until last week I have not encountered many situations in which someone actually spoke this assertion to me. I was certainly aware of it otherwise.\n<br />\n<br />I noticed it because in each case my interlocutor wished to frame his/her remarks in a new reality that supposedly proved his/her conclusions, e.g. \"Everyone knows that everything changed on 9/11, so we had to invade Iraq to fight terrorism.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThis has been much on my mind lately, too.  As Nels wrote in the comments to Dr. Cline's post, 9/11 gave us a glimpse of our vulnerability in one sudden, shocking, collective experience.  The events of that day shifted our understanding of the world in certain fundamental ways, but 9/11 most certainly did not \"change everything.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHere are a few things 9/11 didn't change, just off the top of my head:  it didn't change our Constitution, our laws, our history, or our traditions.  It didn't change our need for access to healthcare, good jobs, and a strong economy.  It didn't change the meaning of fairness, honesty, or truth.  It didn't change our essential impulse to be good to each other.  It didn't change our need to educate our children, nor did it diminish in any way the importance of a free press.  9/11 didn't make us any less obsessed with pop culture or with shopping or gossip. 9/11 didn't make us any less dependent on foreign oil.  Our freedom to travel has been subject to small inconveniences, but not curtailed in the least.  9/11 didn't even change the fundamental safety record of airlines, for crying out loud; flying is still the safest way to travel.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n(My wife makes a good point here:   It is in times of greatest danger when our essential values are most called upon.  We are not a free society only when it's easy.  Our freedoms and our \"American character\" are supposed to be what carry us through when the going gets rough.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n9/11 didn't change everything, but our response to 9/11 changed a lot.  We are less safe, less respected, less liked, and less powerful.  I, for one, am tired of hearing people repeat this worn phrase as prelude to shirking their responsibility or abusing their power.  9/11 did not change the essential character of American society or make us any less a democratic republic.  If any of that happens, we will have done it to ourselves.\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I was inspired by <a href=“http://www.2blowhards.com/archives/001656.html”>this discussion over at 2blowhards.com</a> to leave a very long comment, which I'll repost here:</p>\n\n<p>Michael B., I think that it will be a while before the mainstream press truly understands what's going on in a way that they can write coherently about it.  It's one thing to notice that technology is creating a revolution.  It's another thing entirely to really embrace it, understand it, and use it to the fullest.  Just in the last few weeks, my understanding of how to use technology has shifted dramatically.  RSS, Gmail, Flickr, del.icio.us, and desktop Wikis have all caused me to rethink my options for collecting and managing information.  I've said for years that we're still in the dark ages when it comes to computers.  I think we're a long way from living in a mature world of computer and network technology, much less really understanding it.  I'm not sure many people really can see where this is going.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, I'm working on a new project.  I'm attempting to create a new kind of online history book.  I'm developing a wiki where the narrative and encyclopedic entries about characters and events will be developed simultaneously.  I'm doing this on my own right now, but will soon open it up for others to contribute, much as Wikipedia has been built by the efforts of a large community.  As I develop this project, I realize that there's really no limit to what can be included in or linked to from this wiki.  My long-term goal would be to have original source material for every aspect of the period I'm studying available online - a one-stop-shop, if you will, for people interested in this historical event.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm not way out there on this.  Others (like Michael Brooke, it seems) are working on similar \"deep resource\" projects.  How will this impact culture?  We're going to move from the idea that knowledge is something filtered and parsed by individuals to something that is created and managed by the group.  I think this core idea has always been true, yet the methods we've had to deliver content - books, radio, television, and so on - have mostly been filtered through the narrow perspective of one person or one organization.  It hasn't been practical in the past to develop and disseminate group-think.  Once a book is printed, that's it until the next edition, if there is one.  Any mistakes remain; ideas aren't reconsidered in the light of new evidence.  Moreover, sources remain unavailable to the media consumer in many cases, so independent evaluation of an author's conclusions are impossible.</p>\n\n<p>However, group-reviewed, dynamically updatable resources are available now, the tools to create these are starting to mature, and more of these resources will come online when people start to see how powerful and useful they are.  Libraries are starting to digitize content like Shakespeare's quartos and Lewis Carroll's scrapbook.  The balance of power in cultural filtering is shifting.  It's as if gold went from being something only prospectors could locate in far-off locations to something anyone could create with their own personal alchemy machine.</p>\n\n<p>(I'm also seeing a shift in the way we perceive top-down hierarchies in general.  In business, for example, there are some who suggest that the wisdom of the group is more valuable and \"right\" in many cases than the wisdom of the manager or the CEO.)</p>\n\n<p>Culture will change - back, perhaps - from something you consume to something you participate in.  I've already seen a couple of wikis that attempt to facilitate group-created stories.  More will follow.</p>\n\n<p>Technologically speaking, we are in the midst of a mini-revolution in which computers move from being separate machines with discreet installations of data and programs (analogs of our personal experience) to \"network appliances\" connecting us to a world where applications data, and experience reside on the network and are easily shared.  Everything will interconnect, and we will develop tools (like RSS readers) to help us manage the torrent of information.  Experiences, expertise, and ideas will be shared freely.</p>\n\n<p>Raymond: What can digital do?  It can make all this possible.  People won't simply consume.  Portability and interconnectivity will open humans up to a level of collaboration that was previously impossible.  Wikis and social bookmark sites like del.icio.us are the tip of the iceberg.  This isn't a subtle shift.  Once people start to grasp what's possible in an interconnected world, the sky's the limit.  It's no small thing, for instance, to consider digitizing the Library of Congress so that the information contained therein is available instantly and everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I wax rhapsodic.  I tend to believe that people will use new tools in the best, most culturally enhancing way possible.  It's just as likely, I suppose, that people won't.  However, I am optimistic that once the infrastructure and tools are built, creative people will be called upon to use them.  Culture will grow, as it always has, in the proper medium and conditions, and I like to imagine that this new medium is fertile indeed.</p>\n",

There was little sense of danger or threat at first, and I didn't see the pictures of the planes hitting the World Trade Center, or see the smoking wreckage at the Pentagon until I got home that evening.</p>\n\n<p>For a couple of days we sat glued to the television set &#8211; as, I gather, did most everyone else.  We spoke on the phone with friends from all over the country.  Danielle tried to find out if her friends in New York City were safe and sound (all accounted for, all unharmed, thank God).  I spoke with friends and family about what this all meant.  I recall how sharply life had changed on that day.  My friends were all from the comedy world, and all of a sudden comedy seemed a very hard thing to contemplate or achieve.  We didn't know when, or if, anything would be funny again.</p>\n\n<p>I visited the World Trade Center site last Christmas.  It simply looked like a construction site, except for the tributes lining the fence.  I don't have any personal memory of the towers except for a glimpse of them in passing when I visited New York in 1989.  It's hard for me to fully understand what happened on that day.  Life ended then, and life goes on.  It goes on and we pause and remember and honor the victims and the heroes of that day and the remembering makes life more precious.  My life has changed in so many ways since that day.  I'm married now, and I'm going to go back to bed and lie next to my sleeping wife and hold her tight and thank God for the time we have together, and pray for the victims once more.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Okay, so commenter Robotech_Master made a fair point about Salon.com's ad policy and prompted me to go back and read the <a href=“http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/21/alan_moore_on_our_mo.html”>Alan Moore interview</a> I mentioned yesterday.  I was a little annoyed by the distracting ads flashing and jumping while I was reading the article, but it was worth the effort, and I'm looking forward to picking up some of Moore's work.</p>\n\n<p>Here are just a couple of random things that jumped out at me:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p> <i>And I do tend to think that, given the upsurge of the religious right over the last couple of decades, these are the last spasms of those dinosaur organisms.</i></p>\n\n<p><b><i> Why do you think that? </b></i></p>\n\n<p><i>Because they are standing in the way of history, trying to turn everything, politically and spiritually, back to a medieval vision of the world. Whereas they're perfectly entitled to have whatever worldview they like, I would suggest that humanity is moving in a forward direction. And that any attempt to turn the clock back to a mythical, simpler, or better age would probably be about as effective as Britain's ancient King Canute, who famously sat on his throne along the tide line and ordered the waves to go back. </i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd like to believe this, but I'm not sure I buy it.  I do think it's weird that, on the one hand, technology is moving society into an unprecedented level of connectivity and collaboration, of a type that will probably make the religious right increasingly foolish.  However, on the other hand, the power base in this country is moving further to the right, and in al Qaeda and other groups we see the global rise of radical fundamentalism, so there's a rather complex fault line forming and it's anyone's guess as to what the landscape will look like after the earthquake.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote><p><i>If we look back a few generations to perhaps our great-grandparents, we've got a very different world in terms of its information content. You have a world where the people's heads were more than likely filled with the details of their own lives. I know that sounds completely unlikely from our cultural standpoint, where our heads are filled with the doings of Joey, Chandler, Ross, Fabian, whoever the other ones are, I can't remember.</i></p>\n\n<p><b><i>Sacrilege! </b></i></p>\n\n<p><i>How quickly we forget! [Laughs.] But, yeah, people's heads are stuffed with a fantastic amount of information, and I think all too often they cannot assimilate, digest or connect up that incredible amount of data into a coherent worldview.  </i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah.  This is something Joseph Campbell pointed to; our culture has developed so rapidly that our the old mythology doesn't apply and the new myth hasn't been created yet that will help us assimilate.  It'll happen, but we have to go through this unsettling flux first. </i></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote><p><i>I feel that we may be approaching a cultural boiling point. I'm not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing; I really don't know because I can't imagine it, quite frankly. But I think we may be approaching the point at which the amount of information we are taking becomes exponential, and I'm not entirely certain what kind of human culture will exist beyond that point. Except it will happen sooner than we expect, and the difference between us and the kind of people that will exist after such an event will be vastly different than the difference between us and the hunter-gatherer society we've evolved from.</i></p>\n\n<p><b><i> You're saying we might not be able to recognize human beings of the future that well. </b></i></p>\n\n<p><i>Yeah, it could be a quantum leap, a sudden, massive and unprecedented leap. Boiling point is a good analogy, because what you have before that stage is water. What you have after it is something that does not behave at all like water; it's a completely different substance altogether. And that's what I see looming for society -- and it's probably necessary, probably inevitable, probably scary.</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the concept of the Singularity that I've been hearing so much about lately.  I think we're already in the midst of this, we just haven't quite reached that boiling point yet.</p>\n\n<p>Really interesting, stimulating article.  Thanks for nudging me back over there.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>As much as I love Seattle, I do enjoy being back on the East Coast.  I'll have landed in or passed through some of the greatest cities in the country on this trip - Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, DC - even Mystic, Connecticut!</p>\n\n<p>I'm really settling into the trip now.  I feel I'm in my element on a train, a welcome break from the off-balance way I've existed for the past few days.  Providence is lovely, but the conference folks were definitely from a different world.</p>\n\n<p>The Acela Express trains are not quite up to the standard of their European counterparts - France's TGV and others - but they are respectably appointed, comfortable, and fairly quiet.  Zipping along at speeds of up to 150 mph, the usual clickety-clack of the wheels turns into something resembling the reassuring whirr of a piston engine.</p>\n\n<p>It's an interesting way to see the world, on board a train.  In Europe, I was disappointed in my wish to see the countryside, as the high-speed trains there travel - quite understandably - between view-obscuring berms.  There's some of that to be experienced onboard the Acela, and there are the usual gritty industrial zones and gray, run-down residential areas that coagulate around the rail lines.  However, there are also significant stretches of waterside villages with their marinas and harbors and houses for the wealthy.  I was even able to glimpse a fog-shrouded Manhattan skyline at twilight, just as the lights of the Chrysler building came on.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes later, the train left Penn Station and emerged from the subterranean rail lines into the tunnel of darkness.  Now, with the cabin lights dimmed, the lights tend to be only occasional pinpricks or glowing orange pockets of the odd settlement.  At high speeds, the WHUMP of a passing train rattles the windows and cures us of our hiccups.</p>\n\n<p>The one tiresome aspect of the voyage - only partly alleviated by the new iPod - is the cell phone conversations.  For my part, I'm terribly embarrassed to have my one-way conversations full-volume even in an empty car, much less with other passengers surrounding me.  Heck, I didn't even want to sit in the Quiet Car -where cell phones and loud conversations are banned - for fear that the light typing I planned to do might disturb someone.  But I must have a disease or a syndrome of some kind because others seem perfectly capable of carrying on all sorts of inane gab fests without the slightest hint of regret.</p>\n\n<p>At the risk of sounding sanctimonious, I worry that these folks aren't taking advantage of the great benefit that travel offers - perspective.  Seeing the world at 100+ mph, at the slightly elevated height of the tracks, is to my mind one of the great opportunities of our modern life.  When much of our lives are lived in the canyons of city blocks or the caves of our various dwellings, it's essential to occasionally see the world differently.  Look here and see where our old cars are piled up.  Look there and see people in rags sitting on the stoop of their ramshackle cottage, next to the burned out husk of a brick apartment building.  Watch a bird hang motionless over the mast of a sailboat.  Watch grand cities turn into graffiti-covered suburbs, turn into lush forests, turn into beaches and quaint little downtowns, and back again.  Put the phone down.  Does your wife really need to know for the third time that you'll be in at 10:30?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><b>The Recording Industry Association of America's shrill crusade to end music piracy is making in-roads in Congress.  But is the industry's war of lawsuits and intimidation destined to become a quagmire?</b></p>\n\n<p>Despite <em>Wired</em> magazine's \"report\":[www.wired.com/news/digi...](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,63026,00.html) that CD and album sales were up 10% in the first three months of 2004, and in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, the recording industry continues to call file sharing the biggest extant threat to its existence.  The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) makes war on its customers and pushes for legislation that would make swappers into jailbirds.  And, like the wars in Iraq and in Vietnam, it's hard to see a way out that's going to be anything but bloody and demoralizing for everyone involved.</p>\n\n<p>On March 31, 2004, \"CNET News reported\":[news.com.com/2100-1028...](http://news.com.com/2100-1028-5182898.html) that a House sub-committee has approved a bill that would make sharing copyrighted files a criminal offense.  The Piracy Deterrence and Education Act (\"PDEA\":dw.com.com/redir?destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.i.com.com%2Fcnwk.1d%2Fpdf%2Fne%2F2004%2Fpdea2004.pdf&amp;siteId=3&amp;oId=2100-1028-5182898&amp;ontId=1023&amp;lop=nl_ex) --</p>\n\n<p>bq. \"[...] the result of intense lobbying from large copyright holders over the past six months--has emerged as a kind of grab-bag that combines other proposals introduced in the past but not approved. One section that first surfaced last year punishes an Internet user who makes available $1,000 in copyrighted materials with prison terms of up to three years and fines of up to $250,000. If the PDEA became law, prosecutors would not have to prove that $1,000 in copyrighted materials were downloaded--they would need only to show that those files had been publicly accessible in a shared folder.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if you owned a computer that was found to contain approximately 65 CDs worth of copyrighted music in a shared folder -- whether you put it there or not and regardless of whether the music was actually downloaded by anyone -- you could go to prison for three years.</p>\n\n<p>According to the \"Washington State Adult Sentencing Manual\":[www.sgc.wa.gov](http://www.sgc.wa.gov/) for 2003.  here are some other things you could do to buy yourself a trey in the Big House for your first offense:  Assault of a Child, Controlled Substance Homicide, Hit and Run resulting in death, Homicide by Watercraft/Vehicular Homicide by being Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or any Drug, Malicious Placement of an Explosive, Robbery in the First Degree, or Sexual Exploitation.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Arson, Delivering Methamphetamines, Manslaughter, Vehicular Homicide by operating a vehicle in a reckless manner, Burglary in the First Degree, Child Molestation in the Second Degree, dealing in child pornography, Drive-by Shooting, Unlawful Possession of a Firearm, Use of a Machine Gun in Commission of a Felony, Intimidating a Judge/Juror/Witness, Third Degree Rape of a Child, Extortion, Second Degree Kidnapping, Third Degree Rape, Sexually Violating Human Remains, Counterfeiting, Threats to Bomb -- each of these offenses carry mandatory sentences of 27 months or less in the State of Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is just a partial list, but you can see my point.  If the PDEA were enacted in its current form, the punishment for file sharing would be greater than the punishments for necrophilia or molesting a child.  Heck, by my count you could steal a firearm (14 months), commit sexual misconduct with a minor (12 months), print your own money (9 months), <em>and</em> forge a prescription for codeine (2 months) and you'd only be in prison a month longer than a file swapper.</p>\n\n<p>Or, you could <em>kill someone</em> with your car or boat while under the influence and receive a sentence equal to the proposed sentence for making 65 CDs worth of music available for downloading on your computer.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from putting the kibosh on KaZaA, the PDEA would create a huge new category of criminals.  How huge?  According to the bill's authors, \"the most popular peer-to-peer file trading software programs have been downloaded by computer users over 200,000,000 times. At any one time there are over 3,000,000 users simultaneously using just one of these services. Each month, on average, over 2,300,000,000 digital-media files are transferred among users of peer-to-peer systems.\"  Holy crap.  Think of that - 3,000,000 potential new criminal cases to bring against the users of just one P2P service!  Looks like now's the time to start investing in prison construction companies and FBI futures.</p>\n\n<p>I'm fond of the saying that goes \"Just because a million people do a stupid thing, it doesn't mean it's not a stupid thing.\"  Yet as lobbyists for the recording industry and representatives in the House continue to hammer out laws for extreme protection of copyrights, millions of users currently engaging in file sharing will have to make a choice:  pay the vig to the RIAA's musical extortion racket or face jail time and stiff fines.</p>\n\n<p>I'm safe.  I haven't shared files for some time now.  I admit it:  I have used Napster in the past (the original, mind you, not the namesake).  I also used AudioGalaxy, iMesh, and Morpheus.  I downloaded music, and I made my shared folder available to other users of those programs.  I did it not because I wanted to fill up my hard drive with free music, though that was certainly nice.  No, I used file sharing services because they offered me a way to discover and research artists that I could not find as easily or at all through traditional means.  I found I could no longer turn on a radio and hear music that appealed to me, and I had been burned more than once by buying an album based on the one song I knew about only to find that the rest of the album was completely different.  So the choice offered by P2P programs was a vast improvement to my ability to make informed decisions about music buying.</p>\n\n<p>More than that, P2P offered a way to research artists whose work didn't always show up in a record store, and to - yes, I admit - avoid spending thousands of dollars building a personal library of music that I was only interested in for the historical perspective it offered.  Did that hurt the artists whose music I downloaded?  I would argue that it didn't, mainly because I wouldn't have bought their albums in the first place just on spec.  On the contrary, many artists were directly helped by my P2P browsing because I did end up buying their albums based on what I heard.  For once, I was excited about discovering new music.</p>\n\n<p>But then along came the RIAA with their campaign of tyranny, waving the flag of artists rights, crying financial hardship, and suing music consumers for doing what music consumers have always done - sharing the music of their favorite artists with like-minded fans.  So I stopped.  I stopped sharing, I stopped buying, I just got out of the game entirely.  And you know what?  I don't really miss it.  I'd rather listen to my current collection of CDs and tapes in an endless loop than pay one more dime into a system that rapes artists, sues consumers, and generally stifles creative expression.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I'll be the first to admit that there are some problems with the file sharing model.  For instance, sticking a piece of music on your hard drive when you haven't paid for a copy of that piece of music is, well, probably not cool.  (Sorry to equivocate, but I <em>can</em> imagine a society that actually encouraged that behavior to the economic benefit of all, so I can't bring myself to say that it's just flat out wrong.)  I don't really have a need to own music I haven't paid for.  I'm an artist myself, and I get the economics and ethics of this problem on a very deep, personal level.  However, as a consumer, what I want is to find and experience music free of the linear, controlled output of the radio station.  I don't want someone else telling me what I should listen to.  I want to be able to experience music in the same way that the Internet has taught me to experience words and images - at my whim, at a moment's notice, and with some anonymity.  P2P let me, in essence, program my own radio station based on whatever I was interested in at the moment, the way the Internet lets me program my own news and entertainment experience.  Ideally, I want to be able to browse and select from the vast catalog of recorded music, listening to as much or as little as I want, with some way to compensate the artists fairly for what I consume.</p>\n\n<p>This is not what the recording industry wants for me, however.  The recording industry wants to maintain its exclusive control over the channels of production and distribution of popular artists.  The record companies want to maintain their position as the gatekeepers to musical culture, both for artists and consumers.  The recording industry wants to continue to pay artists pennies and half-pennies on the dollar for their creations while reaping maximum profits for itself.  It wants to maintain control of the media through which we consume music - e.g. CDs, albums, tapes.  The industry wants to be able to keep certain artists out of the game by denying them contracts.  The RIAA wants to maintain control, because control to them is about dollars.</p>\n\n<p>The \"RIAA website\":[www.riaa.com/issues/pi...](http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/default.asp) lays out the industry's case.  Music piracy hurts consumers, music pirates, and honest retailers, as well as record companies and the creative artists themselves.  According to the site, \"Eighty-five percent of  recordings released don’t even generate enough revenue  to cover their costs. Record companies depend heavily  on the profitable fifteen percent of recordings to subsidize  the less profitable types of music, to cover the costs  of developing new artists, and to keep their businesses operational. The thieves often don’t focus on the  eighty-five percent; they go straight to the top and steal  the gold.\"  Presumably, the file sharers, then, can have the dreck from the bottom 85; just don't steal the good stuff.</p>\n\n<p>The RIAA site goes on to say, \" Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the creative  artists lose [because of piracy]. Musicians, singers, songwriters and  producers don’t get the royalties and fees they’ve  earned. Virtually all artists (95%) depend on these fees  to make a living.\"  Indeed.  Yet industry record contracts are notoriously onerous, as Nirvana's producer Steve Albini outlines in vivid detail in \"this essay\":[www.negativland.com/albini.ht...](http://www.negativland.com/albini.html) posted at \"Negativland.com\":www.negativland.com.</p>\n\n<p>Albini describes the typical experience of a band producing material that would fit in the record industry's bottom 85% of recordings.  After laying out a balance sheet that shows just where the money goes, Albini concludes, \"The band is now 1/4 of the way through its contract, has made the music industry more than 3 million dollars richer, but is in the hole $14,000 on royalties. The band members have each earned about 1/3 as much as they would working at a 7-11, but they got to ride in a tour bus for a month.\"  I challenge you to read Albini's full article and then tell me that the RIAA is really worried about how much money the artists might lose to file sharing.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I love this quote at the bottom of the RIAA's anti-piracy page.  \"As  recording artist \"Tool\" noted, \"Basically,  it's about music -- if you didn't create it, why should you exploit it?\"  Tool, of course, was talking about fans.  I'm sure the recording industry didn't intend the irony.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I'm not against the record companies making money.  I can even see their point that it's probably better for almost everyone if there's a healthy industry investing in R&amp;D, discovering artists and consolidating the costs of distribution and delivery of product.  But the industry's knee-jerk reaction to online file sharing has been so convulsive that I'm afraid they're missing a grand opportunity to make the production and consumption of music better and more profitable for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the thing: according to a \"recent study\":www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf (PDF), it seems that file sharing statistically has zero effect on music consumption.  Another \"study\":[www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/...](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000573.html) even suggests that people who use the Internet buy more CDs.  And \"this article\":[www.sfbg.com/38/22/lit...](http://www.sfbg.com/38/22/lit_copyright.html) suggests that publishing work under less-restrictive licenses hasn't hurt the authors who've tried it.  And \"this author\":[www.extremetech.com/article2/...](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1563818,00.asp,) like me, has stopped buying CDs in protest.</p>\n\n<p>And what has been the RIAA's response?  Well, their website contains no response to these studies and lists no evidence of their own to support their fervent pursuit of legal protection.  On its site, at least, the RIAA only admits that calculating the cost of file sharing is \"difficult.\"</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the RIAA is missing a golden moment to use the new technology to benefit artists, producers <em>and</em> consumers.  Indeed, the industry already quietly uses certain services which piggyback on P2P software to measure consumer interest in current music offerings.  By fully and openly embracing file sharing, the industry could profit handsomely.</p>\n\n<p>What if record companies offered their entire catalogs of music online on their own servers?  By charging reasonable access fees, the industry could make a low-cost music library available to everyone, a cultural contribution which would rival the creation of the great libraries of the world.   By reducing prices, the industry could drive sales ever higher, while realizing greater profit through lower manufacturing and distribution costs.  The RIAA has access to a brand new method of promotion and distribution that they didn't have to spend one dime to manufacture, yet they are killing the Golden Goose.  Record companies are willing to leave a gift of immense magnitude on the table in order to maintain a few more years of life as they know it.</p>\n\n<p>And a few more years is likely all they'll have if they can't learn to change with the times.  Countless other industries have met a similar fate during periods of technological revolution, and this revolution will be even faster and more sweeping than ever before.  With tens of millions of users in this country searching for new ways to experience music, P2P as we know it will go the way of the Dodo and some new method of sharing music will spring to the forefront, making the current fuss irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>In fact one \"such method\":[www.downhillbattle.org/itmsscrip...](http://www.downhillbattle.org/itmsscript/index.html) with the potential to give the music consumer greater power is currently under development.  It's a service that could offer highly detailed song information, including whether the distribution company for a song is a member of the RIAA.  With better access to information, perhaps people will actively choose to \"intentionally withhold money\":[www.riaaradar.com](http://www.riaaradar.com/) from the recording industry in a much more effective way than they currently do, adding injury to insult by routing their dollars to more friendly organizations.</p>\n\n<p>The RIAA has also been dealt a series of legal setbacks, which should raise a red flag in the organization that maybe they're on the wrong side of this issue.  A Canadian judge, in a \"case involving\":[www.boingboing.net/2004/03/3...](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/31/canadas_riaa_cant_pr.html) the RIAA's sister organization in that country, denied a motion to reveal the names of alleged file swappers, noting that the existence of P2P programs is no different than putting a copy machine in the middle of a library of copyrighted material.  And just today the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals \"ruled that\":[www.corante.com/copyfight...](http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/003214.html) fair use applies even to material that has originally been obtained illegally.</p>\n\n<p>The struggle for control, the fight to maintain an old system of power, is one that the recording industry simply cannot win.  Prohibitions have never worked.  Suing your customers and creating a criminal class out of your biggest pool of consumers can only breed more virulent forms of protest.  So great is the desire for free choice and free access -- ie. \"free as in freedom\":www.gnu.org, not +free as in beer+ -- that the people will not give it up.  The only question is how many casualties we'll see before the bloody war is over.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I've been getting lost in research for \"The Louverture Project\":www.stumax.com/tlp for a lot of the past couple of weeks.  I think 'lost' is the appropriate word.  Not having attempted anything like a historical study before, I'm feeling a bit swamped by the task.  In the past I've written sketches, plays, that kind of thing, where it's all come out of my own imagination.  Or I've written corporate events, where my job was to research and synthesize material of a relatively limited scope and create a unique work.  Often I've had stock characters to write for, but this job is completely different.  Here, I've got a vast amount of data, an endless array of characters, far-reaching implications, and the only constraint I have to work around is a historical, verifiable time line.  How do I boil this down so that it makes sense?  How do I know what to capture from my research and what to leave out?</p>\n\n<p>I decided that I needed some help, and lo and behold, on my bookshelf were a couple of books I had looked at but never really seen before - <em>How to Write and Sell Historical Fiction</em> by Persia Woolley and <em>The Biographer's Craft</em> by Milton Lomask.  Aside from the nice surprise of having them in my collection, the books were a comfort in that it seems like most of what I'm doing at this phase is just what the books suggest - research, organize, and write as inspiration strikes.  With a few tweaks and some shifts of emphasis, I feel like I'll be back on track.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few quick hits from today's reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>eu·he·mer·ism,  <i>n</i>. A theory attributing the origin of the gods to the deification of historical heroes.</li>\n<li>Two major questions to ask when considering a biography are: Who will want to read it? and What makes it unique? (Woolley)</li>\n<li>\"Truth... makes bad fiction, but fiction should read like truth.  Similarly, fiction makes bad biography, but biography should read like fiction.\" (Lomask, p. 2)</li>\n<li>The \"and\" biography links two or more individuals or an individual and an event, institution, or historical period. (Lomask, p. 3)</li>\n<li>\"There are no rules for composition,\" Claude Debussy said, \"but every composition makes its own rules.\" (Lomask, p. 5)</li>\n<li>\"Residue\" as regards biographical subjects relates to the impact of the individual on present day or the interest which the individual holds for us. (Lomask, p. 10)</li>\n<li>When you send out your biographical manuscript, an editor will want you to list what books on the subject are still in print.  Consult <em>Book Review Digest</em> for help in finding these. (Lomask, p. 11)</li>\n<li>\"If you can't travel, read.\" (Lomask, p. 16)</li>\n<li>Don't quote so much.  \"Good note-taking is précis writing.\"  You're not a file clerk, you're a writer! (Lomask, p. 23)</li>\n<li>Good reference material:  <em>Guide to Reference Books</em>; <i>Dictionary of American Biography</i>, <i>Notable American Women</i> (both for dead persons); <em>Current Biography</em> , <em>National Cyclopedia of American Biography</em>, <i>Who's Who in America</i>, <em>Biography Index</em> (for live persons); <em>American Genealogical Index</em>, <i>Who Was Who</i>; and <em>especially</em> <em>Writings on American History</em> and <em>Writings on British History</em>.</li>\n<li>\"Man is not what we think he is,\" André Malraux wrote. \"Man is what he hides.\"</li>\n</ul>\n",

The so-called new prime minister of Haiti is one monsieur Latortue, who has a lot of chat for someone without a mandate from anyone except the US ambassador and his bosses. He is, he says, going to unite Haiti, so he has begun by boldly leaving out of his 'government' any representative of the people of Haiti. I give him three weeks.</p>\n\n<p>John Maxwell continues to be the most outspoken commentator and the most trenchant observer of the ongoing situation in Haiti.  What has happened to that country in the last 10 years is a farce of epic proportions.  It would be funny if it wasn't tragic.</p>\n\n<p>bq. The world should know that the United States and France bear the major responsibility for the predicaments in which Haiti now finds itself. It is a savage irony, that two of the three nations founded at the end of the 18th century on the ideals of the Brotherhood of Man should continue to hypocritically dismiss the third on no other visible basis but that Haiti is black.</p>\n\n<p>bq. Racism is Racism is Racism. To describe Haiti as a 'failed state\", to say that Aristide misgoverned his country, to allege that the mulatto elite in Haiti are capable of operating a democracy are sick jokes. The mulatto elite and the military have been the junior partners in the franchised predation of Haiti for most of its history.</p>\n\n<p>bq. Aristide was not perfect. Nobody ever claimed that he was. But is George W Bush perfect? or Jacques Chirac? The money misappropriated when Chirac was mayor of Paris could feed a great many Haitians. Does that make Chirac unfit to lead France?\nDoes the fact that Ken Lay of Enron was the largest contributor to President George Bush, or the fact that Vice-President Cheney's company is accused of overcharging the US army for food make either Mr Bush or Cheney unfit to govern the United States and the world??</p>\n\n<p>Well, if it doesn't make them <em>unfit</em>, per se, it sure weakens their authority.  Or, it would in a rational world.</p>\n\n<p>bq. The behaviour of Kofi Annan and the UN Security Council was barbaric. They refused to help a UN member in good standing when his country was threatened by the most disreputable, bloodthirsty assassins. Yet, two days later, when Aristide had been overthrown, kidnapped or whatever, the same group felt impelled to send a 'peace-keeping' force to Haiti. And a few days ago, the World Bank held a donors meeting to consider aid for Haiti. The hypocrisy runs like blood in an abattoir.</p>\n\n<p>I think the abattoir is an appropriate metaphor.  We've turned Haiti into as effective a place of misery as a slaughterhouse, one we can turn our backs on and ignore as long as the meat keeps showing up on our plate.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>In the PBS television series <em>Cosmos</em>, \"Carl Sagan\":www.carlsagan.com attempted to describe how humans are trapped into the way we think about our three<A HREF=\"javascript:popUp('http://www.stumax.com/mt-static/popups/timedim.html')\">-plus-one</A>-dimensional universe.   He used the analogy of a two-dimensional creature, a being who exists only in height and width, and has no concept of depth.  Tootie, let's call her, lives very happily in her two dimensions, gliding gracefully along the X and Y axes, until one day a creature from a three-dimensional world picks her up about a foot above her plane of existence and lets her fall gently back.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Tootie experiences this sensation, but has no mechanism to understand what is happening to her.  She experiences falling through the third dimension, but once she's back safely at home, she can't point to where she was, she can't describe it to her friends, and she can't mentally process her adventure.  She is built to understand the world in two dimensions only.</p>\n\n<p>If Tootie's race of two-dimensional beings is anything like our own, they've probably developed storytelling, myth, and philosophy to try to make sense of their existence.  While someone from our world could look at a 2D world and explain it easily, Tootie and her kind can only hope to approximate such a description.</p>\n\n<p>I think of this example in relation to our own attempts to make sense of the world.  \"Heinrich Zimmer\":[www.alibris.com/search/bo...](http://www.alibris.com/search/books/author/Zimmer,%20Heinrich) said, \"The best truths cannot be spoken, and the second best are misunderstood.\"  And, as \"Joseph Campbell\":[www.jcf.org](http://www.jcf.org/) says, the third best are the things we talk about every day - science, sociology, history, and so on.  Philosophy, mythology and storytelling try to point the way to that dimension that is beyond our reach and understanding.</p>\n\n<p>h4. Dreams</p>\n\n<p>A couple of items have put me on this track this morning.  For one thing, I just finished watching \"Richard Linklater\":[www.theonionavclub.com/avclub373...](http://www.theonionavclub.com/avclub3737/avfeature_3737.html's) \"Waking Life\":[www.foxhome.com/wakinglif...](http://www.foxhome.com/wakinglife/index_frames.html.)  Linklater's films are often packed with philosophical musings, and <em>Waking Life</em> is no exception.  In fact, this movie reminds me a lot of Linklater's first film, \"Slacker\":[us.imdb.com/title/tt0...](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0102943/,) with its meandering style and \"real people\" casting.  The difference in this film is the juxtaposition of objective and subjective camera styles, and the focus on existential themes.</p>\n\n<p><!--more-->\nOh, and it's animated.  Linklater shot and edited the film on digital video. Then, a team of artists used a computer process similar to \"rotoscoping\":[whatis.techtarget.com/definitio...](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci212923,00.html) to animate the film.  The result is that the philosophical themes of the movie are discussed in a dreamlike milieu, dancing and darting in and out of the viewer's conciousness.</p>\n\n<p>The movie is very much about the question of perception.  Do we really communicate meaningfully?  Are we really here?  Are we dreaming, or are we awake?  Can we do both at once?  Can we control our dreams, our thoughts, our destinies?  What are we becoming?  <em>Waking Life's</em> animators, working separately on whole scenes rather than on particular characters or elements, were encouraged to bring their personal styles to the project, and so as an audience our visual understanding of the real world of the movie is constantly shifting, even as the characters are constantly trying to explain the world around them.</p>\n\n<p>To my mind, this is an appropriate metaphor for the real world that I live in.  Time moves on, and reality changes, and the rest of us scramble to explain and understand it.</p>\n\n<p>h4. Memes</p>\n\n<p>The other thing that got me thinking today was \"this article\":[www.straightdope.com/columns/0...](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040312.html) on memes at the Straight Dope.  In it, Cecil Adams also tackles the idea of free will.  The article is a follow-up to \"an earlier article\":[www.straightdope.com/columns/0...](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040213.html) on the same subject.</p>\n\n<p>Memes are reproducible ideas that leap from person to person, shaping the way we think and respond to the world.  As Adams says, a meme is to culture what a gene is to biology.  Memes are tiny, bits of cultural/social code that are passed on more-or-less intact from generation to generation.  The ultimate result of memes, according to some of the top thinkers in memetics, is that we're so at the mercy of memes that we have no free will.</p>\n\n<p>Adams finds this extreme position hard to take, and I agree with him. I tend to think that we have free will if we believe we have free will.  If we think we're victims of fate, then we are.  As Professor \"Robert Solomon\":[www.bedfordstmartins.com/litlinks/...](http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/litlinks/essays/solomon.htm) says in <em>Waking Life</em>, existentialism says that you are in control of your life, you are responsible, and your life can be whatever you want it to be.</p>\n\n<p>That said, memes may explain a few things about how we're influenced by each other.  I have this feeling that we're a lot more like ants than we believe ourselves to be.  In the same way that ants can build incredibly complex societies with what must be very few, very simple rules, so we humans have built vast civilizations that are beyond the capacity of any one or any few of us to even comprehend.  Fashions, fads, and trends come and go without rhyme or reason.  Thoughts or ideas catch fire, urban legends proliferate, stock markets fluctuate, all as if by \"Adam Smith\":[www.lucidcafe.com/library/9...](http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jun/smith.html's) Unseen Hand.</p>\n\n<p>As individuals, we're simply small parts of an incredibly complex chaotic system, yet we are not powerless.  We are at the whim of forces beyond our control, yet we also have reason and intellect and can choose our actions.  In fact, chaos simultaneously pushes us into action, and responds to our choices.  Like a rock, we are shaped by the wind even as we bend the wind around us. And so our actions have an effect, even though we can't imagine what that effect might be.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps these forces of chaos press on us from a dimension beyond our understanding.  Perhaps, like Tootie, we can navigate our conscious world, but will remain by our very nature forever powerless to describe the unseen dimension.  And so, this is the reason for our hunger for philosophy and storytelling.  We must constantly invent ways to understand the forces that act on us, to prevent being swept away by them.  And we must reassure ourselves that we do matter.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>From the Probably-Nobody-Cares Department, which is right next door to the Nobody's-Reading-This-Anyways department...</p>\n\n<p>My roommate says it's good to make lists as you get older.  I assume he means for the purpose of reflection and self-examination, and not just for remembering, say, the names of one's children.  I hope he's right.  I wanted to make a simple list of comedy links to post on my blog, and mission creep has turned it into the following: a list of the most important comedy influences in my life.</p>\n\n<p>Big deal, right?  To the general public, I'm just another faceless link whore who's left his diary on the kitchen counter for everyone to read.  However, in my former life, I was something of a comic actor and improvisor.  Like many others, I found comedy because it made me acceptable.  I was an odd, smart kid with a bowl cut, buck teeth, velour shirts, and thick-rimmed glasses.  My manners and sensibilities were incomprehensible to my teachers and to my peers.  I would not have survived those early years without a sense of humor.</p>\n\n<p>What makes humor such a social lubricant?  For one thing, humor is a way to weep with each other in full view of each other and of the ones who are causing us pain.  So many oppressed groups - Irish, Jews, Russians, and African-Americans to name a few - have a long, proud humor tradition.  Humor can say, \"I recognize my place and yours.  I recognize what we are to each other.  I know this is a game and it's a bit silly, but it is what we have.\"  Humor is a signal of respect and, simultaneously, of defiance.</p>\n\n<p>Humor can also be a warning, like the stinkbug's stink or the rattlesnake's rattle.  Humor is truth, and someone who can really tell the truth to you is not someone you want to fuck with; rather, you want them to be on your side.  At the least, you want them to look the other way and not tell on you.</p>\n\n<p>True humor starts with a common understanding of life the way it really is.  Fat people really <em>do</em> sit around the house.  100 lawers at the bottom of the ocean <em>would</em> be a good start.  It really <em>does</em> take just one psychologist to change a lightbulb (though the lightbulb has to really <em>want</em> to change.)  Humor finds a way to say out loud the truth that we would otherwise only secretly suspect.</p>\n\n<p>Humor is collegial and friendly.  Humor puts its arm around you like a buddy and tells you you're being an idiot.  And if you don't stop being an idiot, humor can pull your pants down and embarrass you in front of your family.</p>\n\n<p>So much humor is based on the unexpected twist, a truth impossible to comprehend without acknowledging the fundamental duality of the universe.  Think of the people you know who don't have a sense of humor.  Notice how they're pretty linear thinkers?  Is there room in their worldview for alternatives?  Humor is the fork in the road, and humorless people can't abide crooked roads or serendipitous destinations.</p>\n\n<p>Humor is popular art.  It's not a coincidence that the best comedians can sell out a rock and roll concert venue. Comedy is music.  It has rhythm, timing, it is in tune or out of tune.  It's also a war.  Comedy kills.  Or it bombs.</p>\n\n<p>Humor is revolutionary, subversive.  It is the mass's way of telling the powerful, \"We can seeeeeee yooou!  We know what your doooo-ing!\"</p>\n\n<p>Humor is philosophical in a very personal way.  Your sense of humor is dependent on your particular way of looking at the world.  Like myth, humor hints at the vital, fundamental, immutable truths of the universe.  And, like myth, humor is never as good or as effective when it's explained to you.</p>\n\n<p>I offer here a list of the humorists and comedians who have influenced me in a profound or formative way. My list leaves out a lot of comics I love, or who were groundbreaking in their time.  Jack Benny, Steve Allen, The Marx Brothers, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce... back to Cole Porter, Will Rogers, Moliere, Aristophanes, and Og the Neanderthal Parodist... These are the giants upon whose jiggling bellies and forked tongues we stand even today.  Modern comics like David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Bill Hicks (RIP), Eddie Izzard, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are defining comedy for a whole new generation. They don't make my list because they were over here when I was over there, if you will; we missed each other. I offer you a very personal and imperfect list.  I'd love to read yours.</p>\n\n<p>I start with The Big Three, the comedians who continue to influence why I laugh, how I joke, and how I see the world.  The rest of the folks on this list have contributed elements of humor or perception that I consciously recognize in my words and thoughts from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Ready?  Cue the \"It's\" Man.  And....</p>\n\n<p>It's.............</p>\n\n<p>h3. The Big Three</p>\n\n<p>\"Monty Python\":[www.pythonline.com](http://www.pythonline.com/)\nThese five Brits and one Amer were probably the most important comedy influences in my life.  Watching their show was like watching an Escher drawing come to life; it made your brain flip from reality to reality quite involuntarily.  It was perfectly logical, yet it couldn't exist in real life... could it?  If I had a nickel for every Pythonism I've quipped to a blank, uncomprehending stare, I'd be as rich as Triple-Suicide-Death-by-Chocolate Cake.  For me, though, I laugh at their routines even today.  At 30 years old, Python comedy is still fresh, clever, edgy and surprising.  They are, quite simply, the best.</p>\n\n<p>\"George Carlin\":[www.theavclub.com/avclub354...](http://www.theavclub.com/avclub3541/avfeature3541.html)\nI saw him in concert for the first time when I was in high school, but I had been listening to his tapes for years, even performing his routines in class and at camp.  His \"fuck all a' ya's\" attitude, his crafstman-like mastery of the common man's English, and his unerring bullshit-divining rod make him my comedy hero.  Like few artists can in this fickle world, Carlin has been able to appeal to successive generations of audiences - from the prudish 50s to the coarse 2Ks - while maintaining his essential Carlin-ness.</p>\n\n<p>\"David Letterman\":[www.cbs.com/latenight...](http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/)\nThe modern generation probably can't imagine this, but back in the day, David Letterman was a breakthrough.  Long before smirky-funny became de rigeur, back when late-night television was still pretty establishment (no disrespect to Johnny Carson, whom I miss terribly), David Letterman blew our minds.  He was hip, self-deprecating, funny, and was willing to mock the television conventions of his era.  Johnny Carson got huge mileage out of being the straight man to whom funny things happened.  David Letterman jumped in a giant bowl of milk while wearing a suit of Rice Krispies.  Carson kept himself at arms distance; Letterman got in and got his hands dirty.  (By the way, am I the only one who remembers that Letterman had a morning show?  Remember Coffee Cup Theatre, anyone?)</p>\n\n<p><!--more-->\nh4. The Close Seconds</p>\n\n<p>David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams' \"Airplane!\":[www.imdb.com/title/tt0...](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/) and \"Kentucky Fried Movie\":[hugereviews.com/Movies/ke...](http://hugereviews.com/Movies/kentucky_fried_movie.htm)\nThis group's later movies have had their moments, but <em>Airplane!</em> had me <em>literally</em> crouched down in front of my seat, bent over and holding my belly laughing.  It was comedy Nirvana.  A couple of years later, I discovered <em>Kentucky Fried Movie</em> and the same, raw, over-the-top comedy.  These guys have had as much influence on any sitcom or comedy movie you see today as anyone else you can name.</p>\n\n<p>\"Chuck Jones\":[www.chuckjones.com/entry.htm...](http://www.chuckjones.com/entry.html) animation\nPurists will quibble over Jones's contribution to the Looney Toons films under his direction, but there's no question that he oversaw the golden age of Warner Brothers animation.  The comedy in those animations was sharp, the comedic syncopations sublime.  Mel Blanc was not only a genius at voices, he had comic chops like nobody's business.  It pains me to see the more recent PC-influenced cuttings of these films, the ones with all the violence cut out.  <i>That's</i> truly offensive.</p>\n\n<p>\"Al Franken\":[www.al-franken.com](http://www.al-franken.com/)\nFrom the days when I watched his skits (and occasionally his performances) on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, I was soaking up Franken's vicious, cock-eyed wit for years, often without realizing it was his.  His books have been comedy gems; I had to stop reading <em>Oh, The Things I Know</em> in the airport waiting lounge because I was shaking with laughter and starting to get some looks.  His latest book, <em>Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</em> is only less funny because it's truth.</p>\n\n<p>\"Tom\":[s2n.org/Articles/...](http://s2n.org/Articles/Lehrer.html) \"Lehrer\":[www.theavclub.com/avclub361...](http://www.theavclub.com/avclub3619/avfeature_3619.html)\nSome impulse - I think it might have been sparked by reading the lyrics from \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\" - made me buy a Tom Lehrer songbook when I was 14.  Long before I heard any of his recordings, I learned the piano parts and lyrics, and impressed my friends at parties - at least at the parties I threw, where the guests couldn't get away.</p>\n\n<p>\"Steve Martin\":[www.stevemartin.com](http://www.stevemartin.com/)\nA comedy legend.  With his white three-piece suit and arrow-through-the head, Martin poked a hole in the self-importance of the 70s and 80s.  He created the modern absurd comic.  Every time I do mock serious, I'm channeling Steve Martin.</p>\n\n<p>\"Cheers\":[www.museum.tv/archives/...](http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/cheers/cheers.htm)\nThe setup, the punchline, the capper, the topper.  The density and rhythm of the show's comedy was phenomenal.   <em>Cheers</em> prompted me to take jokes further.  \"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\" may be one of the finest single episodes in the modern sitcom era.  The occasion was Woody and Kelly's wedding, and for a present the writers gave us a full-on door-slamming farce -dumbwaiter included! - that ranks up there with the <em>Mary Tyler Moore Show's</em> \"Chuckles\" episode for pure poetic comedy.</p>\n\n<p>Art Moger's \"The Complete Pun Book\":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0890096015/qid=1077508542//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-4368411-0762526?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\nMy parents gave me Moger's book just before a long car trip - to their eternal regret.  I giggled and cackled and read puns out loud from North Carolina to Ohio and back.  Puns, as has been noted by finer minds than mine, are the lowest of all wit, which is to say that they are the foundation of all wit.  Art Moger's book was like a Berlitz guide to the language of puns, and I have spoken like a native ever since.</p>\n\n<p>\"Cracked\":[www.crackedmag.com/,](http://www.crackedmag.com/,) \"Mad\":[www2.warnerbros.com/web/madma...](http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/madmagazine/home.jsp,) and \"National Lampoon\":[www.nationallampoon.com](http://www.nationallampoon.com/) Magazines\nThese humor magazines taught me about parody and satire.  I read <em>Cracked</em> incessantly, <em>Mad</em> only slightly less so.  <em>National Lampoon</em> I discovered when I was older, though I didn't understand half of it at the time.  In that sense, NatLamp proved that being smart and funny could be better than just being funny.  Or just being smart.</p>\n\n<p>\"All in the Family\":[www.tvland.com/shows/ait...](http://www.tvland.com/shows/aitf/)\nA case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.  During the uneasy reconciliation period of the civil rights struggle, <em>All in the Family</em> let us laugh at bigotry, racism, and general stupidity.  It showed me that there's nothing wrong with humor that also has a message.</p>\n\n<p>h4. Honorable Mentions</p>\n\n<p>\"Ritch Shydner\":[www.pattersonandassociates.com/bios/Ritc...](http://www.pattersonandassociates.com/bios/Ritch_Shydner/)\nSo he's not so well known, but I mention him here because I'll never forget seeing him live. I've seen many of the big-name comedians - George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, and many others - and I don't think I've enjoyed any single concert as much as I enjoyed Ritch Shydner's.  At a dingy little comedy club in Greenville, NC, Ritch kept the audience laughing for over two hours.  The audience would not let him leave.  He told us he was pulling out material that he hadn't used in years, but we didn't care.  He was on.</p>\n\n<p>\"Bill Maher\":[www.billmaher.tv](http://www.billmaher.tv/)\nHe's the best fusion of heart, brains, and comedy on television.  If I could have anyone else's comic sensibility, I'd want his.</p>\n\n<p>\"Douglas Adams\":[www.douglasadams.com](http://www.douglasadams.com/)\nThe <i>\"Hitchhiker\":[www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/...](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/'s) Guide to the Galaxy</i> is the book I wish I had written.  It's science and philosophy and humor all wrapped up in a neat little package with the words \"Don't Panic\" on the cover.  Rest In Peace, man.  You left us too soon.</p>\n\n<p>\"Saturday Night Live\":[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satu...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live) - \"The Original Cast\":[www.geocities.com/snlra/cas...](http://www.geocities.com/snlra/casts/7580.html)\nWe remember these shows through rose-colored glasses, I know.  They weren't all gems, but when they were good, they were the best.  The talent in front of and behind the camera that was assembled those first couple of seasons may never be matched.  <em>SNL</em> broke new ground in TV comedy.  (How perfect that its first host was my comedy hero George Carlin!)  The intervening years have had their ups and way downs, but I still check in occasionally, 'cause one of the writers is a friend (well, okay, a \"casual acquaintance\":[www.tvtome.com/tvtome/se...](http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/PersonDetail/personid-85113) from some time ago who probably wouldn't remember me, but still...)</p>\n\n<p>\"SAK Comedy Lab\":www.sak.com\n\"My\":www.sak.com/stuart.htm old stomping grounds.  If you're ever in Orlando, go to the parking garage just west of the arena where the Magic play and check out their improv shows.  While their golden age, like <em>SNL's</em>, may also have come and gone, in its time SAK had what I truly believe to be some of the finest comic talent in the world.  Wayne Brady is only the most visible of the SAK diaspora.  You've seen the work of others in countless commercials, TV shows and movies.  Current Artistic Director Dave Russell is probably the funniest person no one has ever heard of.  He should have been the next Peter Sellers, if anyone in Hollywood could have had eyes to see.</p>\n\n<p>\"THEM\":[members.aol.com/vidian811...](http://members.aol.com/vidian811/TEMTEM.html)\nAnother Orlando-bred improv troupe, THEM are some of the nicest, most genuine, and funny people I personally know.  They're out in LA now, getting ready to take over the world.  You'll hear of them soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>\"George Burns and Gracie Allen\":[www.museum.tv/archives/...](http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/G/htmlG/georgeburns/gerogeburns.htm)\nOut of loving tribute, I named my cats George and Gracie.  Gracie Allen can still make me guffaw.  George was the perfect straight man, and a genius behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>\"Abbot and Costello\":[www.abbottandcostello.net](http://www.abbottandcostello.net/)\nMy friend and I won third place in the 7th grade talent show performing \"Who's On First?\"  Not bad, when you figure everyone else in the contest was a singer or a baton twirler.</p>\n\n<p>\"Garrison Keillor\":[www.prairiehome.org](http://www.prairiehome.org/)\nKeillor's <em>Prairie Home Companion</em>, awes me with its consistency.  Forget for a minute that it's on Public Radio and listen anyway as this innocuous-seeming show shoots deadly accurate spitballs of comedy, then turns its head and whistles.  Keillor also executive-produces the fabulous \"Comedy College\":www.comedycollege.net</p>\n\n<p>\"Howard Maxwell\":[www.andrew.cmu.edu/~tbp/peop...](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~tbp/people/1932.html)\nMy grandpa.  His sly, subversive sense of humor has passed down intact to his children and grandchildren.  One of his favorite dinner jokes was to take a bite of poultry, turn to my grandma, and declare, \"Leona, this chicken is fowl!\"  It would make her fume, which caused him no end of glee.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On today, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, <a href=\"http://www.kuow.org/\">KUOW</a> played a “<i>Speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1967, at a meeting of Clergy and Laity Concerned at Riverside Church in New York City</i>” entitled <b>Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence</b>.  The <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html\">text quoted</a> herein was obtained at <a href=\"http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/index.html\">Hartford World Publishing’s World History Archives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The speech is a sensitive, thoughtful, and carefully reasoned indictment of the war in Vietnam.  It is not dogmatic or impolitic.  It does not cater to fear; rather, it calls on our higher selves, our sense of responsibility, fairness, and justice.</p>\n\n<p>King opens with what called him to action:\n“I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. I join with you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together: Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam. The recent statement of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: \"A time comes when silence is betrayal.\" That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam”</p>\n\n<p>He then explains his seven reasons for protesting the war in Vietnam, which I will only briefly summarize here:\n1.  The war pulls away resources that would otherwise go to help the poor in the US.\n2.  It manipulates the poor at home by sending the races to die together who are not allowed to live together in a segregated society.\n3.  It undermines the message that social change can be brought about by peaceful means.\n4.  The war in Vietnam poisons the soul of America, and those who care about America must therefore protest.\n5.  King’s winning of the Nobel Prize for Peace earlier that year was “a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for ‘the brotherhood of man.’”\n6.  And anyway, he says, even if he hadn’t won the Nobel Prize, it’s a Christian value to promote peace, to love and care for all men.\n7.  Finally, it is King’s calling to speak out in brotherhood for those who are “suffering and helpless.”</p>\n\n<p>King then lays out a history of Vietnam’s struggles and the US’s involvement as early as 1945.  He does so in the name of understanding the thought processes behind our so-called enemy.  He goes to great pains to make clear that he does not condone the violent tactics of the Vietnamese.  He attempts not to speak as their apologist, but to understand their side of the equation.</p>\n\n<p><!--more-->\nHe says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made. Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and now he has surely heard of the increasing international rumors of American plans for an invasion of the north. He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy. Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor weak nation more than eight thousand miles away from its shores.\n\n“At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless on Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy and the secure while we create hell for the poor.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>King speaks here and often through the speech of the consequences of our hypocrisy.  The danger of creating cynical warriors is especially poignant.  Following 1945, we must have felt that we could do anything, and after so long couching World War II in the rhetoric of good versus evil, moral versus immoral, and right versus might, after seeing what effective motivation that language was, it must have been hard to stop.  The war machine had been built, after all.  We believed - and World War II showed - that we were a force for good, that we stood up against oppressive regimes.  With the fact of our strength evident after that war, we must have thought we could do anything we wanted.  And with the American people distracted by trying to put their broken lives back in order, those who wished to continue making war must not have felt under pressure to think about the consequences of their actions.</p>\n\n<p>There is a problem with winning a war, you see, and the problem is what to do in peacetime with the men and women you have trained to fight.  Soldiers who build the muscles and instincts necessary to fight a war have little motivation to abandon those skills.  Governments throughout the ages have understood this fact.  There is an argument, for example, that the French military campaign in Haiti in 1802 was part of Napoleon’s attempt to simply occupy the troops who would otherwise be drinking, carousing, fighting, and whoring for lack of anything else to do.</p>\n\n<p>When we failed to provide post-war alternatives to the soldiers and generals who had planned such a successful military campaign against a clearly despicable enemy, we created a vacuum  into which their capabilities and resources would naturally flow, and we abandoned our watch over the American principles which had gotten us there in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>America’s failure to grasp the inherent weaknesses of a military strategy devoid of a reasoned consideration and pursuit of alternatives seems to become a theme in post-1945 conflicts.  (Was it so even before then?)  Certainly, King’s speech resonates loud and clear in light of our current struggles.  Indeed, the following passage could refer as easily to how we squandered the global goodwill we tragically attained during the events of 9/11.</p>\n\n<blockquote>“This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam. Recently one of them wrote these words:\n\n“‘Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism.’\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was in the 1960s!  Can we wonder, then, at what might have caused the resentment against Americans that exploded on 9/11?  Is King again speaking to us today when he says, “It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, ‘Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.’\"</p>\n\n<p>Hollow justifications for war, charges of profiteering, companies who seem to believe they can lie on their balance sheets with impunity... There have been voices warning us for decades to change our ways.</p>\n\n<blockquote>“I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a \"thing-oriented\" society to a \"person-oriented\" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.\n\n“A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life's roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: \"This is not just.\" It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America and say: \"This is not just.\" The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war: \"This way of settling differences is not just.\" This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fairness.  Justice, Compassion.  Freedom.  Were we not taught in school that these are the values of our democracy?  Isn’t our nation founded on principles of fair and equal representation, of voices heard?  Aren’t we supposed to love freedom and hate oppression?  Are we to admit now to abandoning those principles for, what?.... profit?</p>\n\n<blockquote>”It is a sad fact that, because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries.This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has the revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgement against <i>our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions we initiated</i>. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism.” [italics mine]</blockquote>\n\n<p>The failure to make democracy real.  This is what I fear is happening.  I fear that the chasm between what we do and what we claim to stand for is growing ever wider, and will one day be too wide to bridge.  I worry that we will continue to squander the promise of the American Revolution to bring freedom and liberty to all.  I worry most that American liberty will be the next casualty of our inaction.</p>\n\n<p>I hope Dr. King will forgive me for using his speech in this way, for mixing his eloquent argument against the Vietnam War in with my own questions about our current times.  I long to hear speeches like this now.  I long for the kinds of leaders that can speak so beautifully and so well.  I mourn the untimely losses of King, JFK, Robert Kennedy, and Malcolm X.  For whatever their faults, their ideas were important and the ways they presented them were powerful.  I wonder if the legacy of the assassinations of the 60s was not just the silencing of these voices, but the intimidation into silence of others who might speak up for truth and justice.</p>\n\n<p>Where, after all, is anyone today who might say, “If we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.”</p>\n\n<p>Who calls us to action today?  Who pleads today for us to be responsible?  Who appeals to our higher selves?  On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 2004, let us hope that we will see his like again.  Soon.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>From Silencing the Past - Power and the Production of History, by Michel-Rolph Trouillot, p 25:\n“For what history is changes with time and place or, better said, history reveals itself only through the production of specific narratives.  What matters most are the process and conditions of production of such narratives.  Only a focus on that process can uncover the ways in which the two sides of historicity intertwine in a particular context.  Only through that overlap can we discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.”</p>\n\n<p>Trouillot is describing a theory of history much like the philosophy of art.  In art, one learns that the negative spaces have value; what is left out describes the ultimate image as much as the impressions that the artist leaves.  Trouillot is arguing that the same holds for historical silences, and that if we can understand the reasons such silences show up in a particular historical narrative, we’ll gain insight into the complete history.  Indeed, he seems to be saying that one cannot consider history without considering the silences also.</p>\n\n<p>On page 26, Trouillot writes:\n“Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments:  the moment of fact creation (the making of sources); the moment of fact assembly (the making of archives); the moment of fact retrieval (the making of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making of history in the final instance).”</p>\n\n<p><!--more-->\nUsing the example of a broadcast of a baseball game, Trouillot points out that an audience relies on a sportscaster to leave certain things out of the description.

Further, the selection of what matters, the dual creation of mentions and silences, is premised on the understanding of the rules of the game by broadcaster and audience alike.”</p>\n\n<p>Without silence there is no meaning.  For human beings to make sense of our world, we must leave parts of it out.</p>\n\n<p>We do this elegantly well.  Human beings are living filters.  We constantly decide what is or is not important, what we pay attention to and what we ignore.  We could not survive without this skill.  Our brains are not built to process every bit of information at a conscious level.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, our bodies are physical filters.  Our eyes and ears only experience a limited range of the available spectrum, the range that evolution has deemed most useful for our species.  We do not have unlimited physical capacities.  Speed, range of motion, temperature tolerance, memory... any number of limits define the outer edges of who we are and what we are capable of.  In fact, we celebrate and revere the rare humans who can push the boundaries of these limits to the extremes.</p>\n\n<p>When I put on a pair of colored lenses, my view of the world changes.  At first I notice the change, but in time I adapt and accept the view as normal.  To experience a “true” view of the world, I must either mentally correct for the tint of the lens, or physically remove it.  Trouillot seems to say we need to do the same when we read history.  He writes, “...any historical narrative is a particular bundle of silences, the result of a unique process, and the operation required to deconstruct these silences will vary accordingly.”</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A bit of mental spittle:\nWhile I can understand the fear that kept the Haitian revolution from being widely reported 200 years ago, I can not understand why we should have any reason to fear this history today.  I do think that we in the United States have a bit of insecurity about our place in the world.  After all, <a href= http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mdemocracy.html style=text-decoration:none> representative democracy</a> was a grand experiment when the US was founded.  We have jealously guarded our place in the world since.  We have fought to undermine or destroy socialist and communist regimes, especially close to home.  We still boycott Cuba, the lone communist holdout in our hemisphere.  Yet, who could make a serious claim these days that recognition of the Cuban government might encourage communism to take root elsewhere?   When the American system has proven to be so powerful as an economic and political force and communism has been so thoroughly tarnished as a means of government, why would we have the slightest fear that anyone would chose another form?  And if other countries did choose another form of government, why should we care as long as it works for them and human rights are generally protected?  Why does it matter?  We are like the reformed alcoholic or the born-again Christian who wants to convert everybody to our cause, whether they desire it or not, and whether it’s good for them or not.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Just finished reading all 250 posts to the Haiti newsgroup since I joined at the beginning of the year.  Whew!</p>\n\n<p>My brain is on overload right now and I’m still sifting through my thoughts, but here are a few observations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is striking how different reports of the same event can vary so widely.  Of course, this is rather obvious, but I think this is the first time I’ve read about the same event - the Haitian Independence celebration of jan 1, in this case - covered by so many sources.  From AP wire stories to personal accounts to government propaganda, descriptions of particular events vary so widely that it’s impossible for me to know what the truth is.  I can’t tell if Haitians love Aristide or hate him.  Is the Group of 184 a spontaneous and legitimate dissenting voice, or was it manufactured here in the US?  How many people really have been killed in protests during the last month.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I find this all especially interesting now that I’m reading Trouillot’s Silencing the Past.  Given our unprecedented access to information in this age, if it’s impossible to know right now what truth is, how can historians hope to make any sense of it?</p>\n\n<p>To that point, Louise turned me on to the New Yorker article <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/drugaddict/235337.html\">Theatres of War</a> by Daniel Mendelsohn.  In it, the author describes Thucydides’ History of the fall of Athens, and current authors’ attempts to deconstruct it and use it for their own purposes.  The significant discovery for me in the article, though, is that Thucydides wrote a sort of interpreted history.  He wrote the dialog of the players involved, sometimes as if an entire people was speaking with one voice.  He used the device of dialog to try to capture the sense of the debate, the flow of ideas that was taking place at the time.  Perhaps this is what history can do: capture a flavor, an essence.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Haitians, most of them, are poor.  Really, mind-bogglingly poor.  When you read descriptions of people eating mud just to survive, it’s hard to fathom that kind of reality.  Toussaint must be weeping to see what’s become of his country.</p></li>\n<li><p>It seems that all Haitians agree that things need to improve - many of them are desperate for change, for a better life - yet none seem to have any hope that things will really ever be different.  There is outrage and agitation aplenty, but few talk of an actual plan for how things are going to improve.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For my part, my armchair observer’s two cents says that Haiti needs stability.  Aristede needs to serve out his term, even if he spends too much on cars and has goon squads running amok.  The man that Haiti elected needs to finish a term, and elections for the next president need to be held and that person needs to finish HIS term.  Democracy must be seen to be working, and without the further intervention of outside forces.  When Haitians see that they have a voice in the voting booth, they may start to speak with more confidence and authority.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, without money, even a stable governmental body may not make much difference.  Desperate people are driven to desperate measures.  (You see?  You see how easy it is to lose hope for Haiti?)  If the international community would simply release the money that has already been allocated for use in Haiti, and if it could somehow be distributed rationally - perhaps along the lines of the cash infusion that Ireland has seen in recent years - then it’s hard to see how there wouldn’t be some improvement.  Of course there will be abuses, but the current practice of withholding funds is certainly contributing nothing positive.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I’m reading from Henry Adams’ “The history of the United States of America during the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison.”  Zounds!  In this he declares that the Spaniard Godoy, by refusing to relinquish the Louisiana Territory upon discovering he had been duped, had as much influence as the revolt in Haiti on Napoleon’s decision to sell the territory.  The details in Adam’s book are sketchy but tantalizing.</p>\n\n<p>The question of Louverture and Haiti’s role in US history is key as I move forward with this project.  I suspect that my grandfather made a little much of the revolution’s importance on Napoleon’s decision to sell the LA Territory.  If events in Haiti can be established as having had a profound impact on that transaction, then the focus of whatever story emerges should rightly focus on that fact.  If not, then I’ll be able to keep the story in Haiti and not have to explain French and American history in addition to Haitian.</p>\n\n<p>[Just noticed this from the General Editor’s Preface to Adams:  “The books in this series were designed for reading, not research. All documentation has, therefore, been eliminated.”  Then, from the book editor’s introduction:  “Only a few of the high points of the History could be represented here...”  This is an abridged edition.  Time to find a new volume of Adams.]</p>\n\n<p><!--more-->\nFurther reasoning for why Napoleon divested himself of that land appear in “Louisiana Purchase,” by Donald Barr Chidsey.  On page 134, he lays out the case.  Without either a better navy than Great Britain’s, or some sort of way station between France and Louisiana Napoleon could not hope to hold the land there.  “Moreover, he was committed to an invasion of England.” (This is in Adams’ book as well - the French were committed to utterly defeating the English and establishing their own colonies either in America, Africa, or elsewhere.)  Bonaparte needed money and he needed to focus his energies.  (Note that the above line of reasoning is given from Livingston’s perspective.)</p>\n\n<p>In The Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Series in Louisiana History, Vol III, Ronald Smith suggests that Napoleon might have gained a measure of satisfaction in tweaking the Spanish by selling the territory rather than retro-retroceding it to Spain, as provided for in earlier treaties (p53).</p>\n\n<p>Chidsey also touts the idea that the Haiti invasion was only a stop-over on the way to annexing Louisiana. (p133)  However, Korngold suggests Napoleon’s designs at the time were solely on Haiti.  Bonaparte needed to get the money flowing again and reinstating slavery and restrictive trade practices would have done it.  Of course, had things gone differently Leclerc’s troops might well have gotten orders to head to New Orleans.  Yet the secret instructions Napoleon gave to Leclerc when he departed France make no mention of this.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Napoleon inherited the French desire for Western colonialism (Adams).  It does not necessarily follow that it was his sole ambition.  Perhaps he felt he could return to that idea when his other wars paid off.  Through various negotiations, he was certainly trying to buy down as much of France’s debt as possible.  I thought the request that America pay France’s reparations from the Quasi War as part of the LA purchase deal was an arrogant master stroke.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in his essay, Smith quotes a letter from Napoleon to his minister of marine in which he pretty clearly states that he intends to take Louisiana in a move disguised as an attack on St. Domingo. (Smith cites E. Wilson Lyon’s Louisiana in French Diplomacy, 1759-1803; I’ll check the source.)  Napoleon’s spies had told him that they could easily take and defend Louisiana with only 1500 men!  Perhaps the First Consul was planning a multiple strike after all.</p>\n\n<p>Smith makes a good case for Napoleon’s designs on the New World.  Napoleon was readying an invasion force in Holland.  Plans had been drawn up for the colonization of the land West of the Mississippi.  Orders had been given to the head of the force.  Yet the success of Napoleon’s plans rested on continuing peace with England, friendship with America, and a successful campaign in Haiti.  He was thwarted in all three of these, and was dealt another blow besides:  the invasion force was delayed by slow preparations and nasty winter weather in Holland.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that in March of 1803 (far before the outcome in Haiti was conclusive), Napoleon must have realized that his back was against the wall and decided to salvage what he could.  If he had been able to launch his expedition sooner, he might have succeeded in taking control of Louisiana with a far smaller army than the one that ended up in Haiti.  But without a base in the West Indies and with Britain’s superior Navy, Bonaparte couldn’t count on being able to resupply and communicate with his new colonies.  Selling Louisiana to the US gave him money, eliminated some debt, and bought him some time.</p>\n\n<p>For me this puts the revolution in Haiti in some perspective.  Napoleon likely could have taken Louisiana without help from their former colony, but with the other delays and political pressures, the failure in Haiti was another nail in the coffin. In other words, there were lots of reasons that Napoleon decided to sell.  Haiti’s victory over France did not in and of itself open the door to the Louisiana Territory purchase.  I agree with what Bob Corbett has written in that this doesn’t lessen the meaning of what Louverture accomplished.  On the contrary, Louverture’s campaign should be evaluated on its own merits and I think there’s more than enough drama in that story to write volumes.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE\nI just read through the next essay in The Louisiana Purchase, Vol III.  The essay is Pichon, the United States, and Louisiana, by Albert H. Bowman.  Louis-Andre Pichon was charge d’affaires and consul-general to the United States from 1801 to 1805.  He sent regular correspondence to Napoleon regarding the feelings of Americans on various topics of French interest, especially including the Louisiana Territories.</p>\n\n<p>The Americans were vehemently opposed to any French colonization west of the Mississippi, and Pichon was of the opinion that they would fight hard to win that territory should the French claim it.   In addition, Pichon reported that the American population was growing at an alarming rate.  The pressure to expand Westward would be inevitable in time.  These reports surely had a great influence on Napoleon’s thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Note the following from page 77:\n“Although historians continue to speculate on Bonaparte’s motives for relinquishing Louisiana, it is unlikely that any more conclusive evidence than already exists will appear.  There is a certain irony in the persistent suggestion that money was a priime object, since French visitors from Hector St. John de Crevecoeur onward have remarked on the American penchant for money-grubbing.  French historians, noting Bonaparte’s lofty unconcern with such mundane matters, are probably closer to the mark in pointing to his imperial ambitions in the east, through Egypt to India.”</p>\n\n<p>Bonaparte’s “lofty unconcern” seems a mischaracterization given the report I read yesterday in Adams (I think it was.)  That report was of Napoleon in the bath arguing with his brothers that he desperately needed money to make war.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, the bottom line seems to be that Napoleon’s decision to sell Louisiana was initiated by what Bowman says is “Tallyrand’s ‘empire of circumstances.’”  It wasn’t just one thing, it was a bunch of things.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Monday, December 22, 2003 - O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, IL</p>\n\n<p>Despite a threat level of Orange, a rush-hour commute, and a vacation travel crunch, I have sailed past the checkpoints and arrived at the closest Starbucks to gate E9 two hours and 30 minutes ahead of takeoff.  I would like to have stayed longer with my family at Uncle Eric's house rather than leaving early to anticipate the delays,  but until they invent crystal balls that actually work worth a damn, you pays your money and you takes your chances.</p>\n\n<p>The plane touched down in Chicago  just after 11 pm on Saturday.  Carry-on only luggage and a swift crew at Avis allowed me to make it from the gate to the house in under an hour.  I found Dad, Trish  Stefan, Johanna, Claire, Busy, Heather, and Shannon assembling a Mary photo mural.  Mary at her wedding, Mary with friends and family, Mary bravely kayaking in 6 inches of water, Mary in her famous pink bathrobe, Mary emaciated and bald from chemotherapy.  Mary laughing, smiling, or smirking in all of them; an indomitable spirit.</p>\n\n<p>There was lots of laughter and smiling among all of us as well, as there always seems to be when our families get together.  We have always taken joy and comfort in each others' presence, and it was no different here.  I don't know why I seem to forget this so often, how much I <b>enjoy</b> my family.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday morning, we cleaned, straightened, and prepared the house for guests.  We lingered a bit past our departure time, not really wanting to go to the service.  The threat of what we didn't know loomed, the haunting question of what emotions we would face at acknowledging her passing all together at the same time and place, and how we might respond.  We talked on the way, mostly about Johanna's new job and house.  As we approached the chapel, the bare tree limbs and steel gray sky seemed appropriately grim, and the gothic architecture of the University of Chicago added significance to the moment.  The chapel was modest, yet elegant.  Twenty or so rows of wooden pews supplicated themselves to impressive stained glass windows, and carved wooden angels hovered in the rafters.  A harpist played softly as over a hundred mourners filed into the building.</p>\n\n<p>The service was conducted by a Presbyterian pastor who managed to say all the right things and everything well.  He read a letter from Carol Topping, one of the Lombards' longtime friends.  He spoke of Mary's devotion to her family and her commitment to caring for others.  (Her last words were to Eric:  \"Did you eat dinner?\")  Sounding almost Buddhist at times, the pastor urged us to recognize that life and death are two sides of the same coin and that the important parts of Mary live on in and around us.  He managed a perfect tone of respect and celebration for Mary's life.</p>\n\n<p>Johanna got up to tell us about a trip she took with her mother to New Orleans.  Claire said a few words.  I watched the sign language interpreter as the pastor read the closing Navajo prayer, one of Mary's favorites.  It was comforting to be seated there with Trish and my father, in the presence of so many who came to honor my aunt.  I'm so grateful to have attended.</p>\n\n<p>Lots of people showed up at the house later for food and drinks.  There was laughter and joy as we reminisced and got to know each other better.  It was a full expression of love for the family.  It was how I would want my wake to be.</p>\n\n<p>It's Tuesday evening as I finish this.  A stubborn bolt on a cargo door delayed our departure from O'Hare.  I got home to Seattle three hours later than scheduled, but home safe and sound.  I rejoiced in the presence of my roommate, my cat, and my girlfriend.  On Thursday morning Louise and I will leave to see our East Coast families for a few days.  I'm really looking forward to it.</p>\n",

Just before we got to the border crossing, my dad called and said that Aunt Mary is very sick and will likely die either Wednesday or Thursday.  I’m terribly sad about this, but we’re determined not to let it ruin our trip.  There’s nothing to be done.  When I can I’ll try to get a flight back for the planned memorial service this weekend.</p>\n\n<p>After we found the <a href=\"http://www.barclayhouse.com/\">Barclay House</a> last night – and we found it to be very charming and cozy – we walked westerly on <a href=\"http://www.tourismvancouver.com/docs/maps/\">>Barclay Street to Denman</a>, then headed a bit south to Comax, where we found a funky little restaurant called the <a href=\"http://letsgofordinner.com/mainb.cfm?detail=23\">Brass Monkey</a>.  Louise had a delicious salmon and a tasty glass of red wine.  I had the chef’s special pasta and a couple of traditional Canadian beers.  A fine meal.  Lost my debit card.  We walked back to the restaurant.  Couldn’t find the card.  Left my number.  The waitress called a few minutes later; found it!  We walked BACK to the restaurant.  Got the card.  Yay.

Lunched at a wonderful little Italian restaurant right across from the Gallery (we were invited in by the charming proprietor).  Back to the Gallery.  Back to Barclay House.  My aunt died.  Dad called and gave me the news.  She died at noon with the arms of her family around her.  Called Stef.  He sounds fine.  Everyone seems to be holding up.  I’m looking at going to Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>I proposed to Louise tonight.  Gave her the ring right before we went to eat.  She said yes.  My head was swimming.  I could hardly get the words \"Will you marry me?\" out of my mouth.  Thank God she said yes, otherwise dinner might have been a little awkward.  As it was, we had champagne to celebrate and another meal served in a banana leaf at <a href=\"http://www.frommers.com/destinations/moredining.cfm?h_id=45104\">The Crime Lab</a>, a hip little two-story bistro on Jervis &amp; Pender.  Back to the B&amp;B to watch <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100150/\">a movie</a> on the PowerBook and fall asleep in each others' arms in front of the fire that you turn on with a switch.</p>\n\n<p>It’s late.  I'm really happy.  Being engaged, and all.  :-))</p>\n\n<p>Thursday we got up and had breakfast just the two of us in the dining room.  We left our stuff at the house and caught a bus to <a href=\"http://www.granvilleisland.com/\">Granville Island</a>.  The market was full of delicious foods, including the Red Snapper Chowder we had for lunch at the Stock Exchange.  Browsed for Christmas gifts, but nothing leapt out at us.  Took the Aquabus across the water to the bottom of Burrard (?) and walked into <a href=\"http://www.mapgroup.net/\">downtown</a>.  After a quick stop at the Cyber Café in <a href=\"http://chapters.indigo.ca/\">Chapters</a>, we walked to <a href=\"http://www.sophiabooks.com/\">Sophia Books</a> for some foreign language books.  Best find of the trip turned out to be there in the form of the Haitian Creole - English, English - Haitian Creole dictionary by Charmant Theodore.  We continued to the convention center, then tried to go up in the Harbour Centre tower, but they don’t take debit cards!</p>\n\n<p>It was dark, so we walked back to Barclay House, got our stuff, and drove home.</p>\n",

His weaknesses seem to include love of white culture and breeding, disdain for uneducated blacks, and isolation.  Had he taken Moyse and Dessalines, for instance, into his confidence, had he educated them about the reasons behind his policies, they might have been loyal allies instead of undermining his policies.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that Toussaint fell victim to the same sort of inertia that ensnares the greatest of men:  the belief that what got you here will get you there.  Toussaint’s habits of plotting and scheming in virtual isolation stood him in good stead while he worked to gather his forces.  However, there came a time when he needed to draw on the resources of others in the country.  He needed to address the fact that attachment to the old system still existed.  He needed to address the economic incentives that Moyse and Dessalines found in the plantation system.  He needed generals that understood the long term vision, the greater good.  Not reaching out, not letting go of control, believing that he could do everything alone – this was Toussaint’s fatal flaw.</p>\n\n<p>Korngold p.  232 – “[Napoleon] was to say: ‘I have to reproach myself the  attack upon this colony.  I should have contented myself with ruling the island through the intermediary of Toussaint.’”</p>\n\n<p>“ The invasions of St. Domingo, Spain and Russia  were Napoleon’s three capital blunders.  From the historical perspective the invasion of St. Domingo surpasses the two others in importance.  The setback to the Grand Army in Spain, its virtual destruction on the steppes of Russia, had important repercussions on the history of that time and hastened Napoleon’s downfall.  But had Spain and Russia not been invaded, Europoe would still have emerged from the Napoleonic adventure the Europe of the Congress of Vienna.  The invasion of St. Domingo, however, was responsible for the loss by France of its richest colony, and, as a result of that loss, for the sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States.  The sale of the Territory affected the future of the American Continent and of the world to an extent that cannot be overestimated.</p>\n\n<p>“ The Grand Army’s losses in St. Domingo were almost as serious as those it suffered in Spain – 70,000 were lost in Spain, 63,000 in St. Domingo. “</p>\n\n<p>Compare the second paragraph here with what <a href=\"http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/history/revolution/revolution4.htm\">Professor Corbett</a> says.  Corbett makes the claim that Napoleon never had designs on the Louisiana territory, or rather that he only had such designs as would restore Haiti to its former economic importance (i.e., using New Orleans as a supply depot for St. Domingue).  Either way, it seems that Haiti’s fate at the least hastened America’s acquisition of the Western territory</p>\n\n<p>Would Napoleon eventually have sold or released the land to the US at some point if things in Haiti had gone otherwise?  It's hard to see why he would have, though given the disastrous campaigns in Russian and Spain, I'm not sure what use Napoleon could have made of the land. If, though, he had managed to secure Haiti and restore its economic importance, he may not have needed to sell the Louisiana Territories when he did.  The land might have eventually been settled by the French, or ceded to the US or back to Spain.</p>\n\n<p>[In this chapter, Korngold also lays out his theory of Napoleon’s thirst for world domination.]</p>\n\n<p>Also – p. 233 – “Before the French Revolution two thirds of the French import and export trade had been with St. Domingo.”  Two thirds!  The loss of that trade is significant for both sides.  No wonder Napoleon wanted it back.  And no wonder Toussaint turned to Spain, Britain and especially the United States to make up the gap.  He was covering his butt, economically speaking.</p>\n",

Once the Negroes had begun their revolt, once they had been armed and given hope, returning them to slavery would have been impossible.

He was like a surfer on a wave of change, clever and bold enough to stay just a few steps ahead and win important military and economic victories.  Never mind that he was black, that he managed to establish himself as an almost universally loved leader of his country was miraculous.  That he also maintained the highest moral and ethical standards throughout his campaign is a singular achievement.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen references disparaging TL's shifting alliances from France to Spain to Britain and the US.  I see, though, why he did what he did.  Haiti was at the mercy of other countries for their economic prosperity.  When France tried to squeeze the island, Toussaint looked elsewhere for trade opportunities.  When the Code Noir was under attack in France, Toussaint took the necessary steps to preserve the progress blacks had made.</p>\n",

I'm stunned.  I never heard this part before.  According to Citizen Toussaint, the then-Governor of St. Domingue was convinced that the best way to quell any talk of independence among the plantation owners was to stage a slave revolt.  The governor visited the Breda plantation, where Toussaint either volunteered or was suggested as a suitable candidate to organize the mock rebellion.  Toussaint then set the wheels in motion for the events of 1791.</p>\n\n<p>As I originally heard the story, Toussaint joined the rebellion at the age of 47 as a doctor, then rose to the ranks of General.

On the same page of that November 23rd, 2003, Seattle Times was this article about <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001798864_slaves23.html\">child slavery </a>in Haiti.</p>\n\n<p>The first article, entitled \"Haitians too poor to celebrate 200 years of freedom\" (Letta Tayler, Newsday) describes the abject poverty suffered by the 8 million residents of that island nation.  I can't help noticing how much Haiti seems to be a land stuck in time. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is seen by some as just as corrupt as every other Haitian dictator.  Blacks are still overwhelmingly oppressed (mostly by the \"mulatto elite\") and the government's ability to impose order on its subjects is spotty at best.  A little money might help put Haiti on the path of economic recovery, yet a large aid package is on hold because of the tenuous political situation there.  Haiti seems to have been at the mercy of other nations both economically and politically since its inception.</p>\n\n<p>The second article, \"To survive, young forced into servitude\" by Carol J. Williams of the Los Angeles Times, describes child slavery in Haiti.  Young children there are sold into slavery by the most desperately poor parents, often to people only slightly better off than the parents in the first place.  While I suppose that at least slavery can confer some survival advantages to the slave (and better the position of the slave owner, thereby at least theoretically making life better still for the slave), I can only think that Toussaint Louverture is crying a river of tears that the country he loved and fought to liberate could still be suffering so 200 years after his death.</p>\n",
