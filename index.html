		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wonder if Generative AIs are like Ouija boards. Every time I hear someone get freaked out about something that an AI wrote, they ascribe human characteristics to it. They anthropomorphize the computer program and act as if there’s a thinking being expressing human-like desires and feelings. But what the AI produces exists in dialog with the humans who read it. It both comes from human thought (because it has access to a vast quantity of human writing) and it gets filtered through human brains.</p>
<p>We interpret works of art the same way, as if if each piece has a specific, inherent, immutable meaning. But each of us brings something to a work of art. We bring our experiences and biases and we project our own identities on the work in front of us. We create meaning in dialog with the art. The art doesn’t mean anything without an observer. A blob of AI text doesn’t mean anything until we invest it with meaning.</p>
<p>The current crop of AIs are really good at what they do, but they don’t <em>think</em> any more than a Ouija board thinks. A Ouija board isn’t controlled by a supernatural being, but we can convince ourselves that it is if we want to. The AIs are a reflection of ourselves, and that reflection can often fool us into thinking there’s something in there. Like a parakeet with a mirror. It’s a really cool and useful trick, but let’s not give the really clever software more credit than it deserves.</p>

			 <p>I’m almost 4/5 of the way through my <a href="https://www.uclaextension.edu/environmental-studies-public-policy/sustainability-environmental-studies/certificate/sustainability">Sustainability Certificate</a>, and have hit on a new way to process and review the instructor’s weekly lectures. I’m recording the audio of the lectures from Safari using <a href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a>, and then converting speech to text using <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a>. I then re-read the transcribed lecture and take notes.</p>
<p>MacWhisper has become astonishingly good. In the first few weeks of class, the text output was pretty accurate, but it was delivered as just a bunch of lines of about the same length, with no regard for where sentences began or ended. I needed to paste the MacWhisper output into BBEdit, strip all the line endings, and then parse through the text manually to break up the sentences and paragraphs and correct (usually a very few) errors. This week, though, I just copied the MacWhisper output and pasted it straight into my Craft note and didn’t have to change a thing. The sentences were broken out separately and names and other content were captured almost perfectly. Just remarkable.</p>
<p>Now I have a searchable text archive of the course lectures and my notes, which will make referencing these in the future much easier. Wish I had this system in place for previous classes.</p>

Just added this to my queue after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/j2IyijbuajA">this video</a> where McDonough talks about the philosophy and design thinking behind the book. He has a really inspiring and motivating take on designing for sustainability. In short, it’s: Why is getting to zero (waste, carbon, etc.) our goal? We can do better.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every once in a while I do a project that requires transcribing recorded audio. It&rsquo;s never something I look forward to, because creating the transcriptions can be tedious and time consuming, and getting them onto the video can be a chore, especially if you&rsquo;re doing them in a program like Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.rev.com">rev.com</a> to transcribe audio . For $1 / minute, Rev will create transcriptions or captions for your videos. They have quick turnaround times and high-quality output.</p>
<p>But today I decided at the last minute that I needed to caption a 3-minute video and didn&rsquo;t want to wait two hours for Rev, if I could help it. So I did a quick search for transcription apps and was reminded of <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a>, a combination app and service that provides both automatic and human-powered transcription.</p>
<p>Long story short, Descript is amazing. I downloaded the app, dragged my video file into the main window, waited a minute or so, and had a pretty darn good automatic transcription that I could start cleaning up in the app. Descript lets you quickly bounce back and forth between editing the transcript and playing the audio, so it was a snap to go through and fix the small number of errors I found. (If I had been willing to wait a bit, I could have sent the audio out for a higher-quality human-powered transcript.)</p>
<p>When I had the text the way I wanted it, I used Descript&rsquo;s share button to output the file as time-coded subtitles to an srt file, which I further tweaked using BBEdit. I then used <a href="https://handbrake.fr">Handbrake</a> to burn the subtitles onto a new video file.</p>
<p>(I also tried burning the subtitles using <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, which offers more options for displaying the text over the video, but the app got stuck in a continual loop when I tried to export.)</p>
<p>Total time, including researching how to do each step: about an hour. If I had known what I was doing, I could have easily done the work in less than half that time.</p>
<p>If I had wanted a very specific or higher-quality look to the video, I could have <a href="http://www.kcprotrade.com/2018/06/14/adding-subtitles-in-final-cut-pro-x-easy-languages-tutorials-bonus/">created Photoshop files using automation</a> and placed them in the video using Final Cut Pro X. But the output I got from the method I used is very good, and probably suitable for most purposes.</p>
<p>(I should note that YouTube does a decent job at auto-captioning videos, and supports adding your own srt subtitle files. But this video wasn&rsquo;t going up on YouTube, so that wasn&rsquo;t an option for me in this case.)</p>
<p>Descript is such a well-designed program that I kind of wish I had more captions to do. But for the next time the need arises, it&rsquo;s nice to know that what&rsquo;s usually a dull, mundane, and frustrating task can be as close to pleasant as it gets.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/john-wick-3-review-film-parabellum-1203210529/">This review</a> of <em>John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum</em> pretty much echoes my own feelings, especially this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But as masterfully executed as the action is, watching two-plus hours of mayhem without any palpable dramatic stakes, or nuance, or any emotion at all save bloodlust offers undeniably diminishing returns.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite going into them with low expectations, I really liked the first movie, and especially the second, because as over-the-top as they were, there were pretty simple stories to follow, and Wick himself was sympathetic.</p>
<p>I found it much harder to understand the logic of <em>Chapter 3</em>, or to care much about the characters. There were a lot of good ideas, yet none of them seemed to add up to much. The action scenes were amazing, but without stakes, they started to feel gratuitous. Boring, even.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still be there if there&rsquo;s a <em>Chapter 4</em>. If so, let&rsquo;s hope the filmmakers can recapture the formula that made <em>Chapter 2</em> so good: stakes + a clear goal + great action = a cracking good time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My beloved Tampa Bay Lightning are down 2-0 in their series with the Columbus Blue Jackets, losing both their games on home ice. For a team that tied the record for regular-season wins at 62, that never dropped back-to-back games all year, that has a seemingly endless well of talent, it&rsquo;s an absolutely gobsmacking situation.</p>
<p>Plenty of teams have come back from two games down in the playoffs. Some teams have even come back from three games down. But Tampa was so thoroughly dominated in the first two games that something major will have to change for them to dig out of this hole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly no hockey expert, but I <em>am</em> a pretty avid fan of the sport who has been watching the Lightning intently for the past 27 seasons, and I&rsquo;ve been kind of worried this would happen. Playoff hockey is not like regular season hockey. The goal of regular season hockey is to get enough wins to get into the playoffs, and to stay relatively healthy doing it. In the regular season, talented, under-sized hockey players like those that fill Tampa&rsquo;s roster can use their speed and quickness to get into the soft spots and find goal-scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>In playoff hockey, there are no soft spots. In playoff hockey, guys step it up a dozen notches, throwing their bodies around as if they were rented. In playoff hockey, it takes grit and toughness to win games, but also size and strength and an ability to physically dominate your opponent.</p>
<p>Tampa has built a team around fast, nimble, and under-sized forwards and young, talented defensemen. In the last two games against Columbus, the forwards were getting pushed around and the defensemen were showing their inexperience. (Actually, even Ryan McDonagh, who&rsquo;s been so solid all year long, looked like he was out of his depth a few times.) And when the Lightning tried to come out and play a more physical game, as they did in the second period of Game 2, they didn&rsquo;t do it smartly. Alex Killorn&rsquo;s late hit early in the period earned him an interference penalty which led to a Blue Jackets power play goal.</p>
<p>In the regular season, the Lightning dominated their opponents by finding the time and space to create plays. In the playoffs, that time and space doesn&rsquo;t exist unless you create it with your body.</p>
<p>In the regular season, the Lightning&rsquo;s bread and butter were quick passing and pretty goals. In the playoffs, pretty goals are much, much harder to come by. More often than not, it&rsquo;s gritty goals, greasy goals, and lucky bounces that come your way because you&rsquo;re just relentlessly pounding away around the crease that are the difference-makers.</p>
<p>John Tortorella is a great coach (he led the Lightning to a Stanley Cup win in 2004, after all), and the Blue Jackets are a talented team that have been out-playing the Bolts for 5 out of 6 periods so far.</p>
<p>John Cooper is a great coach, too, and I believe the Lightning have it in them to go all the way this year. But in the back of my mind, I worry that they&rsquo;re a team built for the regular season and not for the playoffs.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong, boys.</p>

			 <p>Bottom Line: If you are having trouble getting your Plex server&rsquo;s remote access to work, try logging into Plex.tv.</p>
<p>It took me an embarrassingly long time to figure this out.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my eero network to the newest hardware. It was super easy to swap out the hardware, set the new devices up with the same SSID and password, and just keep on truckin'.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I upgraded my Mac mini to MacOS Mojave, which included up/down-grading Mac Server. I had been experimenting with the mini as a VPN server and made a few tweaks to my eero configuration to allow the VPN to work. (Sadly, the new Mac Server software has removed VPN and quite a few other features, but I digress&hellip;)</p>
<p>Some time after I made those upgrades, I noticed that I couldn&rsquo;t connect to my Plex library, either internally or externally. Every time I went to Remote Access on the Plex server settings page, it would show &ldquo;Not available outside your network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hmm&hellip; Surely this was a problem with the eero, right? It must have screwed up my port settings somehow. I knew it was too good to be true! I tried everything I could think of, including completely re-configuring my port forwarding settings on the eero, but I just couldn&rsquo;t get the Plex server to respond. This went on for weeks, with me trying different tactics in odd moments when I&rsquo;d have a few minutes to spend with it.</p>
<p>Rather than continue to search DuckDuckGo for answers, I finally went directly to plex.tv to see if I could figure out. I logged in to the site, and &hellip; boom! Everything started working again.</p>
<p>Sure would&rsquo;ve been nice to have some indication that I needed to log in to my account, but I&rsquo;m just glad everything is finally up and running. If you find yourself in the same situation, try going to your Plex account on Plex.tv and logging in. It may just save your sanity.</p>

<p>The main roads were in pretty good shape when we walked the neighborhood earlier, but all the side streets are snowy with an icy layer underneath. If you go anywhere in Seattle, you need to either go up a hill or down a hill, or probably both, and a lot of the hills are icy or slushy. I&rsquo;m not chancing a drive to work tomorrow, and it looks like that might be the right move this whole week. Oy.</p>

<p>We’ve gotten about 6 inches of snowfall so far here in northeast Seattle. It’s unusual for this city to get that much snow at once, and even more unusual for it to stick around for more than a day or two. We’re enjoying it now, as it’s beautiful and peaceful and we’ve laid in supplies for the next few days. A good excuse to snuggle under a blanket and read a bit.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->He<!-- raw HTML omitted --> adopted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>We came around the side of our apartment building on Alki one early summer evening to find him on the walkway. He jumped three feet off the ground when I reached out to touch him, but he didn&rsquo;t run. He followed us up the stairs and stopped at the doorway, watching us for a while, chatting, until he wandered off to wherever he came from.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And so it went for the next few weeks, us returning home, him on the walkway, following us up to the third floor and waiting at the doorway, never coming in, but hanging out on the landing to chat, getting head rubs, and occasionally even sitting on my lap, but only if I sat in the doorway.</p>
<p>And then, after weeks of this routine, always stopping at the threshold, he decided to come inside.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We had George put to sleep the year before. George had mega colon, a condition where the walls of the large intestine become weak, making it hard to pass stool normally. He had surgery to remove the affected section of his bowel, which bought him maybe a year before the disease progressed and he was too weak to eat or use the litter box, and we had to take him to the vet one last time. 
And then that day a year or so later that Leo decided to enter the house, he walked with purpose straight past three open doors and into the second bedroom and found the small basket of cat toys we hadn&rsquo;t been able to bear parting with, and Leo took out one of George&rsquo;s toys and began to play with it as if he had known it was there all along.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then one night a week or so later, he didn&rsquo;t leave the house at the end of the night like usual. Instead, he walked straight over to one of the living room chairs, jumped up, curled into a ball and went to sleep. And my wife and I looked at each other and thought, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And so he became part of our little family. He had no collar, and the vet said he had no microchip. We&rsquo;re not even sure how old he was. The vet speculated he had been abandoned or kicked out of his house or circumstances had changed such that he wanted to get away from home. This was not uncommon, he said.</p>
<p>We named him Leonardo, after DaVinci. He seemed intelligent and empathetic and occasionally stubborn, like an artist, so the name seemed to fit.  Later when we got Lucy as his companion and he acted like a cranky bachelor towards her, &ldquo;Leo&rdquo; seemed to fit him better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Leo liked to play, as all cats do, but mostly he liked to sit on our laps or lay on any blanket that covered our legs or bellies, which was a-ok with us.  We developed a routine, and Leo kept us to it. Saw us off to work in the morning, greeted us when we got home, rounded us up for bed and tucked us in. Like clockwork, every day for 12 years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding about the routine. I started calling him the majordomo. At a certain point in the evening after we had wound down from dinner, Leo would prowl around agitated or start meowing or sometimes just sit and stare at us, all these ways of letting us know it was time for bed. He would monitor our activities as we got ready. Many nights he would wait outside the bathroom while I brushed my teeth and then he would walk right beside me, marking my pace exactly as I made my way to the bedroom. As soon as I was in bed, he would stand on my chest and purr, and often lie down on top of or beside me. When Louise got into bed, he would nestle next to her and lay there until he knew we were both sound asleep.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As much as he and I were bonded, he really preferred Louise. He wanted to be on her lap or beside her the minute she would get home. Almost every night he would stand on her lap while she ate dinner, purring and just wanting to be close. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid to demand affection. If we were scratching his cheeks or head and we stopped too soon, he would pull our hand back to his head with his paw. The guy was a love sponge, soaking up every minute of affection and closeness he could take, and releasing it back to us, especially when he knew we needed it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yesterday was our last day with him. What we thought was kidney disease turned out to be cancer and it had moved in throughout his body and taken its toll. And though he was right beside me and so present &ndash; so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; purring, taking care of us while we were taking care of him, his body was breaking down and the list of his maladies was long and the end was inevitable. Leo deserved to live a long, healthy life and die in his sleep. What he got was this.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We brought him home from the emergency vet to keep him comfortable and give him as much love as we could before the end. We spent a good 28 hours with him, making plans for the end, giving him love, and supporting each other through our grief. I tried not to cry, but it was so hard and I failed often. He was with us for much of our married life. With us through two moves, two of us going to grad school, two burglaries (which must have been terrifying for him), through job and life changes and our grieving over lost loved ones. He was a constant. Faithful, kind, loving, gentle. It&rsquo;s hard to contemplate life without him in it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All we can do now is be grateful for the time we had, for the fact that he decided to become part of our family and that he committed to our life together every bit as much as we committed to him. We&rsquo;d have been much poorer over the last 12 years without Leo. We&rsquo;ll miss him terribly, but we&rsquo;re so lucky to know what we&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, my friend, and thank you for being a part of our lives. I love you now and always.</p>

<p>This is absolutely gut-wrenching. The Glasgow School of Art is Charles Rennie Mackintosh&rsquo;s architectural masterpiece. I&rsquo;ve been closely following the restoration process since the fire four years ago; they were on the verge of re-opening during the 150th anniversary of Mackintosh&rsquo;s birth. To lose so much of this iconic building at this point is heartbreaking. I can only hope the school can be rebuilt yet again.</p>

			 <p>Well, it was a hell of a game, but congratulations to the Washington Capitals. I was really pulling for Vegas, but the Caps dominated four top-notch teams to win the Stanley Cup. Their forechecking, physical play, and disciplined defense was truly impressive. And Ovi&rsquo;s passion seemed to lift his entire team to another level.</p>
<p>It still stings not to see the Bolts come out on top, but at least they got bested by the ultimate champs. You gotta respect the Caps' talent and work ethic throughout the playoffs. There&rsquo;s no doubt they earned their first place finish this year.</p>
<p>But just wait till next year&hellip; 🏒</p>

			 <p>Well, the Lightning made it a series, but congratulations to the Washington Capitals on taking the Eastern Conference title. They put together four convincing wins in this series. When they&rsquo;re on their game, they can be absolutely dominating. I would like to have seen a game where both teams were at their best, but I feel like that never really happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the Lightning for 25 years, ever since they came into the league. This is a very good team, one of the best I&rsquo;ve seen, and they have a load of talent, but they just couldn&rsquo;t get past Washington&rsquo;s physical play and relentless forechecking. The Stamkos line never seemed to be a threat, the way the Ovechkin line often did. It&rsquo;s not pure goal scoring talent that wins Cups; you also need grit and physical play. The Caps just had more of that than the Bolts did this series.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ovi, he&rsquo;s playing like a man possessed. He is absolutely carrying that team on his back. That fire, that drive, is what I never really felt lived in the bellies of the Lightning. Not as much, anyway.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one good thing about the Lightning losing this series, it&rsquo;s that I can cheer for the Vegas Golden Knights without reservation. There&rsquo;s a team that also plays with heart, talent, and grit. This could be a Stanley Cup series for the ages.</p>
<p>Congrats to the Lightning for a great season, especially considering they even didn&rsquo;t make it to the playoffs last year. This was still a hell of a year for them, and there&rsquo;s no taking that away. Let&rsquo;s do it again next year, boys, and next time, let&rsquo;s take it all the way. Go, Bolts! 🏒</p>

			 <p>We went to see the play<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_(play)">Familiar</a> by Danai Gurira, last night at <a href="https://seattlerep.org/Plays/1718/FM/Synopsis">Seattle Rep</a>. (Very good play and production; emotional, funny, cathartic.) At the end of the show, they played a song I recognized but couldn&rsquo;t quite place, so I SoundHounded it. Turns out it was <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/emabhaceni/1319472337?i=1319472338">Emabhaceni by Miriam Makeba</a>, which I knew from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Northern-Exposure-Music-Television-1990-95/dp/B000002OMG">Northern Exposure soundtrack</a>. Curiousity about the artist led me to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Makeba">this Wikipedia page about Makeba</a>, and she sounds phenomenal.</p>
<p>Born in South Africa in 1932; endured untold hardship at an early age; survived an abusive marriage, breast cancer, and cervical cancer; became an international music star; married Hugh Masakela and Stokely Carmichael (at different times, natch); protege of Harry Belafonte; recorded with Belafonte, Nina Simone, and Dizzy Gillespie; UN goodwill ambassador and civil rights activist; died on stage in 2008. What a remarkable, rich life.</p>
<p>So, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ain&rsquo;t the modern age marvelous? Technology enabled a chain of exploration that satisfied my curiosity, enhanced my recall, and led me to an unexpectedly delightful discovery. And this happens all the time, and we take it for granted. Every once in a while it&rsquo;s nice to acknowledge what marvels we have access to.</li>
<li>There are so many great life stories to be discovered; I&rsquo;m inspired by Miriam Makeba&rsquo;s. Who inspires you?</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danai_Gurira">Danai Gurira</a>, playwright of <em>Familiar</em>
and several other successful plays, is also a kick-ass human with an interesting background. Not only is she an award-winning playwright, she&rsquo;s an accomplished actress. You may know her as Michone from <em>The Walking Dead</em> or Okoye from <em>Black Panther</em>.</p>

(And sometimes you’re wrong, which is nice.) Sometimes you’re oblivious to the flaws in the thing you’re working on, but you know something’s not quite right. And sometimes, you feel like everything is clicking. Sometimes you just know: this is going to be a good one.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about my personal publishing empire. I’m really liking micro.blog. I like the community, I like the philosophy behind it, and I like the quality of conversations that happen on the service.</p>
<p>One thing that drew me to micro.blog was the idea that I would own my own content. However, there’s a bit of friction involved in posting to micro.blog through my own site that I’d like to eliminate.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’m currently set up:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the problems:
In Step One, it’s not that easy to post to a WordPress blog, especially on a mobile device. I want to just tap out a quick post, but I have to set the category and post type, which adds a bit of friction. And if I include an image, there are additional steps to make sure that posts properly (and it doesn’t always work on the first go.) MarsEdit does make this easier, but there’s still more overhead than I’d like.</p>
<p>And, according to Johnathan Lyman on the micro.blog Slack, my character set is incompatible with emojis. It should be utf8mb4 instead of utf8. And check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this lovely set of instructions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on how to convert your database to a different character set. No thank you.</p>
<p>Cross-posting to micro.blog works pretty seamlessly, as does cross-posting to Twitter. My problem is I don’t always want to cross-post to Twitter.</p>
<p>So, I really have to think before I post about all the places where what I write is going to show up and what it’s going to look like in each place. And this overhead — although it’s not massive — is enough to make me abandon some posts entirely because I just don’t have the capacity at that moment to think through all the consequences.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s a good thing. The world certainly doesn’t need all my ephemeral thoughts. But part of the benefit of micro.blog <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be that it becomes easier to blog, and therefore I would blog more regularly.</p>
<p>How do I solve this? I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reverse the flow: switch to a hosted micro.blog and start all my posts there, and then have it flow into my personal WP blog for posterity. It feels like this would lower the friction significantly, but it would also further fracture my online presence. I’d also have to pick <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blog for the posts to flow into. But I’ve been debating consolidating the two blogs anyway. I’m not sure it was the right choice to begin with.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sigh.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> First world problems, right? I’m still noodling on this, but I’m strongly considering switching to a hosted micro.blog at stumax.info. That would make my publishing flow look like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This feels better. But am I missing something? In the m.b Slack, Mark Hughes pointed out that there’s some overhead with this approach if you want to set categories, tags, or post type for the posts you’re bringing in to your WP blog. Which, yeah… I want to have that stuff.</p>
<p>Stuff to think about. More to come…</p>

			 <p>I’ve really been enjoying reading my micro.blog timeline since I joined up months ago. It’s a high-signal, low-noise environment, with a lot of quality contributors.</p>
<p>But the way I’ve been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my micro.blog stream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the past couple of weeks hasn&rsquo;t sat right with me. I&rsquo;ve been writing for an audience on Twitter, not for micro.blog. Which is weird, because normally I couldn’t care less about Twitter. But because I’ve been working on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this conference<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I’ve been using the motivation to promote the conference on Twitter to drive my motivation to post more here (and hopefully get my 30 day pin).</p>
<p>But the stuff I’ve posted is really marketing. It doesn’t sound like anything that’s of interest to the community here. It wouldn’t be interesting to me. And the tone isn’t personal, so it feels out of place.</p>
<p>So, I apologize.</p>
<p>I’ve been really wondering what I should write on micro.blog. Heck, l have a hard time figuring out generally what my personal publishing approach should be. I keep two different blogs for my personal interests (stumax.com) and my professional interests (turninggrille.com). Whether that’s the smartest thing in the world is a question for another day.</p>
<p>Currently, both blogs are set up to cross-post to micro.blog, and my micro.blog is set up to cross-post to Twitter. In the spirit of owning my own content, this feels right: all content starts on my own blog.</p>
<p>But in practice, writing stuff on my own blog that’s intended to promote something to a Twitter audience doesn’t seem necessary, especially when micro.blog then becomes just an intermediary for the content.</p>
<p>So, I think what I’m going to do from now on is only post promotional content directly on Twitter. Which means I’ll have to come up with something more interesting to say on micro.blog if I want my 30 day pin. Which feels better all around. In fact, I think I’m going to take a skip day tomorrow and start the clock over again on my 30 days. If I’m going to do this, I want to do it the right way.</p>
<p>No one has complained or anything, and I’m sure no one <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cares about this but me. But I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> care. So… there it is.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In late December, I upgraded my mid-2012 MacBook Pro to a 15” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.  It’s a definite improvement over my 2012 MBP. It’s solid and well-made and beautiful and I like it more the more I use it. The screen is beautiful. Just… gorgeous.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I thought I’d post some notes on my early impressions. If you’re on the fence about ordering one of these machines, maybe this will help you decide.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These two features may be the unheralded genius attributes of this new Mac. Touch ID is every bit as slick on the Mac as it is on the iPhone, and what I’ve noticed after using it (and Apple Watch unlocking) for a few weeks is that I’m much more likely to pick up and use my Mac because there’s far less friction now between when the Mac is closed or asleep and awake and ready for me to type. There’s no more waiting on the system to wake up and get reset; it’s just ready to work when I am. The Mac feels more like a fancy iPad now because of this responsiveness.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I kind of like the keyboard. I can see why it’s not right for everyone, but it’s not horrible. It’s a bit clacky for my taste, but I can live with it. You could definitely bang out some satisfyingly angry emails with this keyboard.</p>
<p>I do feel like I make more mistakes when typing on it, though, because it’s hard to feel the difference between keys. I often end up hitting a couple of keys simultaneously or hitting the wrong key entirely. I have the hardest time with modifier keys. I’m getting better with time, though, and most of my typing is on external keyboards anyway.</p>
<p>I don’t love the arrow key layout. Hopefully I’ll get used to it, but the half-height up and down keys are definitely harder to hit reliably.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The Touch Bar is very cool and I’m using it more and more. I was most worried about the lack of an escape key, but I got used to the soft escape key really quickly and it isn’t really an issue for me now.</p>
<p>My favorite Touch Bar feature so far is the scrolling list of slides when you’re presenting a Keynote deck. It’s so easy to swipe that list and find a slide to go back to. I never want to be without this feature again.</p>
<p>There are some UX issues with the Touch Bar. The inconsistency of what’s in the bar at any given time can be annoying. I like the ability to switch tabs in Safari using the bar, but sometimes that feature is there and sometimes it&rsquo;s replaced with other functions because my cursor is in a text field or whatever. You have to stop and interpret the features available from moment to moment in the touch bar, which makes it hard to create a habit around using it.</p>
<p>I wasn’t initially sold on having the Touch Bar controls for brightness, volume, etc. versus having dedicated hardware switches because it added an extra couple of steps to changing settings. But then I discovered that you can just touch the control and swipe in one motion to change brightness and volume. That’s sweet!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I know this hasn’t been true for everyone, but my battery life has been phenomenal right off the bat. I plugged the Mac in for a day and let it download iCloud and Dropbox files and do whatever else it needed to, and I am already getting way more battery life than I did with my mid-2012 Mac; maybe two to three times as much? As long as I’m not doing anything that hits the processor too hard, I can reliably run it for most of a workday without plugging in. I’m looking forward to seeing how that holds up in the weeks ahead.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I decided to start the machine from scratch and only install the things I actually use on the new Mac. I’m a bit of a digital dilettante, and I try lots and lots of software. As you can imagine, a lot of it gets used briefly and then never again. Getting rid of this cruft and only installing things as I need them feels great.</p>
<p>1Password is a real boon here, as I keep all my software registration information ready for just such an occasion. Evernote and Pinboard are helpful, too. I’m compulsive about keeping a list of everything I install and uninstall on my Mac. I’ll have to write up that process one of these days, but suffice to say if my system is stolen or goes tits up, I can recreate my environment on a new Mac fairly faithfully.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also make a lot of tweaks to my system that can take a long time to recreate. Not using migration assistant means a lot of these go away and I’m left scratching my head trying to figure out how I accomplished some shortcut or other. I try to keep notes in Evernote to help with this, but I’m not as diligent about that as I should be.</p>
<p>For example, I added some program to my old Mac that let me drag a window while holding down control and shift; now I have no idea what software that was. (Update: I found it! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Better Touch Tool<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So good. And it lets you customize the Touch Bar.)</p>
<p>So, it’s going to take a long time to get this new machine all tweaked to where I really like it, but the good news is that with Dropbox and iCloud, it took almost no time at all to get me up and running with a usable system and almost all my data intact.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yeah, you need ‘em, but maybe not as many as you think. I like the feel and flexibility of the USB-C ports, so I don’t have a problem with transitioning to them. I’ve managed to get all the dongles I needed to get me back up and running the way I was with my last Mac without spending much at all.</p>
<p>If you want a good all-in-one dongle solution, may I recommend the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Huawei MateDock USB-C Multiport Adapter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s currently $89 on Amazon, but somehow I managed to snag one for just $39, so wait for a sale. This thing has two USB-A ports, an HDMI, a VGA, an ethernet port and an extra USB-C all jammed into a nice little package that fits easily in your back pocket. I use it as my Swiss Army Dongle for connecting to various displays at work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My one major gripe in this whole process was that the new power adapters are $79 and they don’t come with an extension cable ($19) and they’re useless if you don’t buy a USB-C charging cable (also $19). Which I didn’t know, which necessitated a second trip to the Apple store. Grrrrr.</p>
<p>Actually, that reminds me of my other major gripe: The MagSafe power connector from my Thunderbolt Display is now useless (there’s no adapter from MagSafe to USB-C), so I had to buy the above extra power adapter and run yet another cable behind my desk. Grrrrr.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Gripes aside, I just really love this new Mac. It feels solid and self-assured in every way. Moving to this from a 4-year-old Mac, I can definitely appreciate the constant refinement of features over the last few years. I wish the keyboard was a little deeper, but I’m not sure I want to trade that off for the extra thickness. I think the Touch Bar interactions could use some rethinking, but it’s got some real promise. Everything else, though, is beautiful and works like a charm. All things considered, I’ve got no regrets about getting this new Mac.</p>

<p>A key to accomplishing the mission, from the Kochs' perspective, is countering super PACs and other big-money groups funded by rich liberals, as well as allied public sector unions and academic and media elites. The Kochs’ allies feel that those forces have worked together for decades with Democratic politicians and government bureaucrats to institutionalize the philosophy that heavy regulation and taxation of business is the only way to ensure an equitable society.</p>
<p>The Kochs concluded that defeating this well-funded left-wing infrastructure requires tracking the professional left in real time &ndash; a capability they realized they lacked after the 2012 election.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Information architecture can be summarized as the design discipline that organizes information and its navigation so an audience can acquire knowledge easily and efficiently. For instance, the information architecture of a Web site often provides a hierarchy of Web pages for drilling down from general to detailed information, different types of Web pages for different purposes such as news and documentation, and so on.</p>
<p>An information architecture is subliminal when it works well. The lack of information architecture is glaring when it works poorly. The user cannot find information or, even worse, cannot recognize or assimilate information when by chance it is encountered. You probably have experience with Web sites that are poorly organized or uneven in their approach, so that conventions learned in one part of the Web site have no application elsewhere. Extracting knowledge from such information resources is exhausting, and users quickly abandon the effort and seek the information elsewhere.</p>
<p>The same issues apply with equal force to other online information systems, such as help systems. The organization and navigation of the information has a dramatic impact on the user&rsquo;s ability to acquire knowledge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Oh, and it&rsquo;s animated.  Linklater shot and edited the film on digital video. Then, a team of artists used a computer process similar to &ldquo;rotoscoping&rdquo;:<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci212923,00.html">whatis.techtarget.com/definitio&hellip;</a> to animate the film.  The result is that the philosophical themes of the movie are discussed in a dreamlike milieu, dancing and darting in and out of the viewer&rsquo;s conciousness.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>He says:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>“At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless on Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy and the secure while we create hell for the poor.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>“‘Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism.’&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>“A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand we are called to play the good Samaritan on life&rsquo;s roadside; but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life&rsquo;s highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it is not haphazard and superficial. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: &ldquo;This is not just.&rdquo; It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America and say: &ldquo;This is not just.&rdquo; The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just. A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war: &ldquo;This way of settling differences is not just.&rdquo; This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation&rsquo;s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Using the example of a broadcast of a baseball game, Trouillot points out that an audience relies on a sportscaster to leave certain things out of the description.  Vin Scully, for instance, wouldn’t generally describe for us the actions of the fans in the stands, the inactive players on the field, the players in the bullpen or dugout, and so on.  On p 50 Trouillot writes, “If the account was indeed fully comprehensive of all facts, it would be incomprehensible.  Further, the selection of what matters, the dual creation of mentions and silences, is premised on the understanding of the rules of the game by broadcaster and audience alike.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Further reasoning for why Napoleon divested himself of that land appear in “Louisiana Purchase,” by Donald Barr Chidsey.  On page 134, he lays out the case.  Without either a better navy than Great Britain’s, or some sort of way station between France and Louisiana Napoleon could not hope to hold the land there.  “Moreover, he was committed to an invasion of England.” (This is in Adams’ book as well - the French were committed to utterly defeating the English and establishing their own colonies either in America, Africa, or elsewhere.)  Bonaparte needed money and he needed to focus his energies.  (Note that the above line of reasoning is given from Livingston’s perspective.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

It&rsquo;s all about economics.  Always.  Who stands to get rich?  Who stands to lose money?  The Colonial Pact kept France as Haiti&rsquo;s exclusive trading partner, which made French merchants rich and Haitian plantation owners not as rich as if there had been free trade.  Meanwhile, their neighbor to the North had declared independence and were free to develop their own trade policies.  What a burr that must have been!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
